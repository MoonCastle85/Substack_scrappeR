The UBI is Worse Than the Status Quo;https://betonit.substack.com/p/the-ubi-is-worse-than-the-status;"Here’s my reply to philosopher Chris Freiman’s defense of the Universal Basic Income. He’s in blockquotes; I’m not. I agree with Bryan that the right question to ask about a universal basic income isn’t whether it’s the best possible option but rather whether it’s better than the status quo. If we replaced the current welfare state with a UBI, would that be an improvement? I think it would be. Not quite. Given how bad the status is, I maintain “The UBI would be worse than the status quo” is a harsh but fair indictment of the UBI. My actual view is that we should try to find the best possible option. But if you’re worse than the bad system that already exists, you’re definitely not the best possible option. One major advantage of a UBI over the status quo is that it’s better for recipients. To motivate this idea, suppose your employer gives you the following choice: take your annual $1,000 bonus in cash or receive free lunches at the office with a total value of $1,000. Surely you’d take the bonus in cash. Why? Because if you want the lunches, you can use the cash to buy them. And if you don’t want the lunches, you can use the cash to buy something else. You’re overlooking the best argument for in-kind redistribution: child well-being. Let’s be blunt. The very fact that you need taxpayer help is a reason to question your personal responsibility. Which is in turn a reason to doubt that you will be a responsible parent. If you give parents cash, they may spend it on alcohol. Giving parents food stamps reduces this risk. While we’re on the topic of personal responsibility, Chris really should be more open to the possibility that some adults predictably make bad decisions. And while libertarians will want to defend their right to go to hell in their own way with their own money, they needn’t (and shouldn’t) defend the use of taxpayer money to subsidize self-destructive journeys. So what about the downsides? Bryan argues that the UBI is wasteful—if you were running your own charity, “you’d target spending to do the most good. And unlike the UBI, the status quo makes some effort to so target its resources.” I’ve got a couple of thoughts here. First, while the status quo does make some effort to target its resources, it doesn’t do a very good job. As Michael Munger points out in Tomorrow 3.0, welfare spending amounts to about $42,000 per family of three in poverty per year, which would be more than enough to lift them above the poverty line if it were distributed to them directly. So a lot of welfare spending simply isn’t reaching those who need it the most. How does that argue for expanding the system to fund everyone? The reason we can afford to spend $42k on every family of three is that most families are ineligible for funding. Second, we can make a UBI progressive with adjustments on the tax end. It’s true that even Bill Gates will get a check—and that looks wasteful—but he’ll be paying far more into the UBI than he’ll be getting out. Plus, this consideration should help allay worries about the affordability of a UBI. Chris, you keep talking about this issue in general terms, when you should be looking at actual number crunching. Ed Dolan, a libertarian fan of the UBI, was able to squeeze a UBI of $4452 out of the 2014 welfare budget. Does that seem sufficient to you? Did Dolan make serious mathematical mistakes? Are you dramatically altering the hypothetical? Just saying “we can make adjustments” really isn’t good enough if the adjustments would have to be massive. And I honestly don’t see how they could be anything but massive. Look, if you give $10k per year to every person, with a marginal tax rate of 25%, you have to put 100% of the net tax burden onto the shoulders of families earning over $160,000 per year! Progressivity at lower income levels will help, but a tweak won’t do. Even mainstream Democratic economists like Jason Furman say so. They like redistribution, but they like accurate number-crunching more. Bryan raises another concern about UBI’s lack of targeting—those who simply choose not to work will still receive money. And there’s a clear reason to worry about this: it will incentivize people not to work… However, a UBI will also improve incentives to work in some cases. To take one example, replacing the status quo with a UBI would eliminate benefit cliffs. A recipient of a benefit faces a “cliff” when they’ll lose more than one dollar’s worth of the benefit upon earning one dollar of income; thus, someone facing a benefit cliff has a strong incentive not to earn that dollar of income. A UBI doesn’t create any cliffs—earning more money won’t reduce your benefits. Of course, it could be that a UBI creates worse incentives than the status quo, all things considered. Yet evidence suggests that we shouldn’t be too worried that a UBI will cause a dramatic drop in employment. As one overview of the effects of a UBI puts it, “The evidence from diverse interventions in low-, middle-, and high-income contexts indicates minimal impact on aggregate measures of labor market participation, with some studies reporting an increase in work participation. When reductions do occur, time is channeled into other valued activities such as caregiving.” Kevin Lang, another mainstream Democratic economist, says otherwise. Why are you so cavalierly accepting sanguine stories from social scientists you would normally read skeptically? There’s a second reason to be concerned about a UBI’s lack of targeting… In brief, while taxing someone to help those unable to work may be just, taxing them to help the person who is perfectly able to work but would prefer to surf (to take an example from Philippe Van Parijs) is not. What, though, should we do about the problem of the surfer? Presumably the way to address it is to restrict access to the money somehow. But this creates a new problem: restrictions will inevitably exclude some people who need the assistance along with those who don’t because they’ll create administrative burdens that make it more difficult to access the benefit. Frankly, these “admistrative burdens” are a feature, not a bug. If you aren’t desperate enough to overcome moderate bureaucratic hurdles, how dire can your situation really be? I favor the unconditional income program for two reasons. First, as noted above, evidence suggests that a UBI won’t prompt many people to drop out of the workforce to spend their days surfing. Second, and more importantly, it’s worse if someone who needs help doesn’t get help than if someone who doesn’t need help gets help. That is, it’s morally better if both the surfer and the child from a poor family receive assistance than if neither receive assistance. At minimum, your judgment should depend on the size of the two groups. But if you’re going to be deontological about all this, what about the rights of the taxpayer? Again, your attitude seems cavalier. Final point: While we have many moral and empirical disagreements, the biggest comes down to cost. Forget every other issue. Simple cost estimates for a UBI are simply astronomical. $10,000 a person times 330M Americans is $3.3 trillion. That’s more than double what the U.S. will spend on Social Security in 2023. I have immense respect for your intellect, Chris. But seriously, how can you get around numbers like that?!";1322
Critical Comments on Anarcho-Capitalism;https://betonit.substack.com/p/critical-comments-on-anarcho-capitalism;In response to the Brook-Caplan debate, one of my Portuguese readers sent me the following set of critical comments. I’ll respond in a week or two. Enjoy! Hey Mr. Caplan,  I’m Rodrigo, from Portugal (so English isn’t my first language, but hopefully it should be good enough for our purposes), and I’ve been an admirer of your work for several years. I’m not sold on anarchism, though. But you’re a very original thinker who’s managed to shift my views on various subjects so I’m open to the idea that there might be something about your case for anarchism that I’m missing and that’s why I’m sending this email.  Beforehand, I read your Anarchist FAQ, The Anarcho-Statists of Spain (which I thoroughly enjoyed! Thought you made a great case as to why anarcho-capitalism is at least more internally consistent than left-anarchism), and The Economics of Non-State Legal Systems. If you have more essays or articles making the case for anarchism I’d be happy to read them as well.  I’ve read a lot of anarcho-capitalist literature over the years. The main names (other than yourself) being David Friedman, Murray Rothbard, Hans-Hermann Hoppe, Gustave de Molinari, and Lysander Spooner (it may be anachronistic to use the term for the last two, but I think it’s fair to say they’re at least ancap-adjacent). But I was never really convinced.  First, a common argument you make which seems pretty convincing at first is that there are more private security guards than police in the US (and maybe a few other countries as well). You also mention gated communities and private commercial arbitration as prime examples of the market providing services that are typically thought of as the sole province of government.  But my main objection to that is simply that all of those exist within a framework of laws provided by the government. It’s not at all clear to me that those would work just as well without a government providing a robust rule of law that applies to everyone in society.  To further emphasize this point, if we look at history it’s clear that the most successful nations are the ones that adopted free-market principles to the largest extent and that the closer we get to laissez-faire the better the outcomes, in terms of freedom and prosperity, seem to be.  But all examples of tremendously successful and relatively laissez-faire economies, whether historical (late 19th century America and Britain) or contemporary (Switzerland, Singapore, Hong Kong, and a few other city-states) have existed under a system of laws provided by the government.  By contrast, stateless societies have been the norm for large chunks of human history. Various anarcho-capitalists have cited medieval Iceland and Ireland as examples of societies that had elements of anarcho-capitalism. I’m honestly not educated enough about these to judge properly, but both lasted for multiple centuries (according to Murray Rothbard in For a New Liberty, the “libertarian” society of Ireland even lasted for a thousand years) and neither seems to have led to anything remotely close to the industrial revolution in terms of growth and innovation. I’m also going to assume they fall short by these standards of even other pre-industrial societies such as Ancient Greece or Renaissance Italy. And I highly doubt that medieval Iceland or Ireland were anything even remotely close to beacons of freedom that protected individual rights in the way classical liberals and libertarians would have it.  There seems to have been something unique about the British (and later, American) political tradition, when it comes to the rule of law and the protection of property rights, which took centuries to develop (starting from at least the Magna Carta) and played a crucial role in enabling the industrial revolution and the unprecedented increases in freedom, prosperity, innovation, and overall human flourishing of the 19th century. Given the examples I mentioned of successful nations with relatively free-market economies backed by a strong rule of law provided by the government, when we compare them to the mediocre stateless societies it seems reasonable to conclude that a good legal system is a precondition of free markets, not the other way around.  And, to clarify, I’m willing to fully concede that the standard Hobbesian objection to anarchism might not be true in all cases. It’s entirely possible that whatever social arrangement they had in medieval Iceland or Ireland, it was in fact close to anarcho-capitalism in some respects and it didn’t lead to constant gang warfare. And also that if we were to repeat that kind of system today it might not necessarily lead to chaos in the streets. I just think that, by the various standards I mentioned (including individual freedom), this kind of system seems to fall short of free-market economies with a legal system provided by the government. It’s not at all clear that, even if those security firms don’t go to war with each other to resolve disputes, whatever compromise they would come up with would respect individual freedom better than even the status quo today in most Western mixed economies.  To his credit, David Friedman acknowledges this eventuality in The Machinery of Freedom, when he recognizes that an anarcho-capitalist society might be far from libertarian/classical liberal in terms of rights-protection.  Another, more obvious, objection I have to anarcho-capitalism is that if the “free market” (which, without a government, we might as well call the state of nature) leads to an efficient provision of the government services involving the use of force, then how did governments even come about in the first place?  Finally, there are two sort of big deals in life that I haven’t seen any anarcho-capitalist address convincingly: children and nukes.  Under anarchy, what happens when a child abuser has a kid? Sure, you could point to the many flaws in the government system, but at least there’s a relatively uniform system of laws in place that apply to children. Under anarchy, children presumably wouldn't be customers of any rights-protection agency.  Similarly, you could point out that, under government, absolute maniacs like Kim Jong Un and Vladimir Putin have access to nuclear weapons. But still, the number of people in the world in possession of nuclear weapons is relatively small and they’ve only been used in one war in the span of almost a century. There are far worse possible outcomes than that.  What happens under anarchy? Could anyone just own a nuke? While developing a nuclear weapon is obviously no walk in the park, it seems reasonable to assume that under anarchy there would probably be more nukes than today given the billions of people on Earth who would suddenly be free to develop and own them. Even if one buys the idea that nuclear proliferation leads to more deterrence at the international level, I think it’s definitely not crazy to have more than a few doubts at the individual level. Anyone with a nuke could basically declare himself a tyrant.  On a related note, a problem you’ve acknowledged in The Economics of Non-State Legal Systems is the sort of catch-22 that the more economies of scale for the production of security would exist under anarchy the more effective that society would be at protecting itself from foreign threats, but also the greater a risk of cartelization there would be between the few security firms that could thus consolidate back into a government (which might or might not be worse than those we have today). And vice versa.  And, sure, you’re absolutely correct when you point out that “National defense is, strangely, only a public good on the assumption that some military forces are a public bad.” But if an anarcho-capitalist society would require the entire world to eliminate its military forces in order to be able to protect itself from foreign threats… Well, you see the problem.   I know this is A LOT, but I’ll be thankful for any thoughts you can give! And I’m looking forward to your debate on the subject with Yaron Brook. Unlike him, I don’t necessarily agree with the resolution that “anarcho-capitalism would definitely be a complete disaster for humanity,” I just highly doubt it would be anything better than mediocre given the alternatives.;1426
The Best Open Borders Conversation;https://betonit.substack.com/p/the-best-open-borders-conversation;Five years ago, I tweeted this: Unsympathetic readers took this as further proof of my insufferable arrogance, but Aporia’s Noah Carl was impressed. Impressed enough to invite me on his podcast and try to convert him to a view for which he has little sympathy: the cause of open borders. We talked about three months ago, but due to a big backlog, our podcast just released. It’s an unusual format, because Noah lets me walk him through my argument, step-by-step — and let’s me repeatedly check whether he’s still on board. Noah has a brilliant and careful mind, so even his small concessions are valuable in my book. Since this is reality, I don’t actually convert Noah in real time. I probably never will. But all insufferable arrogance aside, I think you will be amazed at how far I get. Listen to the whole thing — or read the transcript.;155
This is Your Brain on News;https://betonit.substack.com/p/this-is-your-brain-on-news;Even people friendly to my views routinely point to recent headlines and ask, “Doesn’t this make you question your views?” I can’t remember a single time anyone has ever pointed to a recent headline and asked, “Doesn’t this make you more confident in your views than ever?” You could sarcastically conclude, “That’s because all the facts are against you, Bryan.” Consider, though: What newsworthy event could even conceivably show, for example, that Muslim immigration to the First World is fine? The news is never going to announce, “Another week without an Islamist terrorist attack. Muslims are looking better by the day!” Which reveals the deep truth: The problem with news is the format, not the facts. Facts that undermine hysteria don’t count as news. Once you understand this, the rational way to consume news is to constantly ask yourself questions like: “In a well-functioning society of 8 billion people, how much bad stuff would be reported anyway?” I never sympathized with BLM, but when I learned that the total number of unarmed blacks fatally shot by U.S. police in 2019 was 14, even I was astounded by BLM innumeracy. Hundreds of kids drown in U.S. swimming pools every year, but there will never be riots about that. Nor should there be. If you have the steely temperament to watch news without losing your mind, I salute you. Otherwise, you will think more clearly if you quit cold turkey. Which is the just one of the angles Rob Wiblin and I examine in my latest 80,000 Hours podcast, “Why You Should Stop Reading the News.” Since the next big election is coming up, fixing your bad news habits is about to become more vital for your clarity and peace of mind than ever. If not now, then when?!;306
"Walsh and ""The Role of Religion in History""";https://betonit.substack.com/p/walsh-and-the-role-of-religion-in;"You can’t understand human history if you don’t understand religion. And no matter how much — or how little — you now understand about religion, these four lectures on “The Role of Religion in History” by George Walsh will leave you edified. Walsh starts with “primitive religion” — animism, magic, and beyond. Then he moves onto Indian religion — first Hinduism, then Jainism and Buddhism. (His discussion of Buddhism alone is worth the price of admission). From there, he covers Judaism and Christianity. And finally, fearlessly, he analyzes Islam. Lecture 1: Primitive Religion Lecture 2: Indian Religion [moderate sound problems for this lecture, unfortunately] Lecture 3: Judaism and Christianity Lecture 4: Islam If you were raised in any particular religion, Walsh’s wry yet clinical lectures on comparative religion are eye-opening. And if you weren’t raised in any particular religion, I honestly think you’ll be amazed by how much you’ve been missing. To my mind, reading and rereading Marx or Hayek to find out what they “really meant” is a waste of time. If we still don’t know, it’s because they weren’t clear. In contrast, reading and rereading seminal religious works to find out what they “really meant” is revelatory. Why? Because they’re the product of a team effort that spans decades, centuries, or even millennia. Dozens of not-so-like-minded shadowy figures wrote the original texts, which were in turn compiled and heavily edited by religious and political elites with heavy-handed agendas that would have baffled the original authors. As usual, Walsh is a joy to hear. So learned. So funny. But unlike almost all of his other lectures series, “The Role of Religion in History” was transcribed and published as a book in 1998. Still available on Amazon. (Actually, the book contain edited transcripts of not only this six-hour series, but his subsequent six hours on “The Judeo-Christian Tradition."" Audio lectures coming eventually!)";325
The Perfect Time to Speak Your Mind;https://betonit.substack.com/p/the-perfect-time-to-speak-your-mind;"Over the last decade or so, wokeness largely conquered U.S. higher ed. Things were never good in the Ivory Tower; left-wing bias was already intense in the 1980s. But starting circa 2010, the situation on-campus proverbially went from bad to worse. Two of the most glaring changes: Classic support for free speech eroded. Professors and students really did start to get punished by their own schools for speaking and writing un-woke things. At first, I only saw these changes on social media. After a few years, however, people I personally knew started to endure persecution. True, outsiders might deem the ultimate punishments mild. Remember, however, that the process is the punishment. If your school allows an anonymous person to file a harassment case against you for a tweet, then dismisses the case after you lose months of sleep and $10,000 on lawyers, you’ve still been punished harshly! Top university administrators started taking official positions on current events and policy issues: BLM, gun control, MeToo, Ukraine, Covid, and more. Indeed, they started making official pronouncements about “our values” such as Anti-Racism (TM). If you’re on the mailing list for the typical university president, you know what I’m talking about. Since the October 7 Hamas attacks, though, many prominent U.S. universities have suddenly embraced free speech and even political neutrality. Harvard is infamous for its rock-bottom FIRE score, but after October 7, President Claudine Gay channeled Voltaire: In the speech, Gay reiterated the University’s commitment to free expression, though she did not specifically refer to the student groups that co-signed the Harvard Undergraduate Palestine Solidarity Committee’s controversial statement on Israel. “That commitment extends even to views that many of us find objectionable, even outrageous,” she said. “We do not punish or sanction people for expressing such views, but that is a far cry from endorsing them.” Yale is infamous for its weak-kneed response to the great Halloween costume controversy, but after October 7, President Salovey’s mind grew very broad: When facing tragedy, we can feel our differences intensely. Regardless of how we view the war in the Middle East, I believe in the strength of this community. We remain committed to open dialogue and to sustaining a community of respect. I call on all of us to treat each other with compassion and understanding and to reject discrimination and intolerance in any form. My own President Gregory Washington just emailed all of GMU: As we have stated repeatedly, protestors have a constitutional right to speak their minds as long as their actions remain lawful, peaceful, and non-disruptive to our educational mission. Today’s actions violated all three of those conditions.  As committed as we are to maintaining everyone’s constitutional rights at Mason, this university is equally committed to maintaining a safe and lawful environment required for our educational mission to be possible.  The cynical story is that deeply woke universities leaders privately sympathize with Hamas, but are too timid to openly say so. Hiding behind free speech and political neutrality is their next-best option. The optimistic story is that until recently, crypto-sensible university leaders’ were too afraid of woke activists to stand up for free speech and political neutrality. Regardless of the true story, the vocal revival of these old-time academic principles creates amazing opportunities for faculty and students who has been practicing self-censorship during the Woke Dark Ages. Let’s take university leaders at their word. Hrish Joshi wrote a whole book called Why It’s OK to Speak Your Mind. Undergrads, grad students, faculty, post-docs! You’re probably never going to get a better chance to go full Hrish. Wokeness tried to redefine mere discussion of anti-woke ideas as “harassment” or worse. Now is the time to start vocally yet calmly discussing all of them — including, but not limited to: The economics of discrimination Discrimination in academic admissions and hiring (“affirmative action”) The reality of human intelligence (“IQ”) The many causes and effects of differences in IQ Racial differences in IQ Racial differences in criminality The Success Sequence The reality of gender differences The many causes and effects of gender differences The many reasons why men outearn women The “women-are-wonderful” effect The many empirical problems with the feminist worldview “Love is love.” The case against abortion The plight of the incel Gender realism “Gender-affirming care” as a euphemism for extreme self-harm If transgenderism makes sense, why not transracialism? Transableism? The upside of European colonialism Though I’ve got mixed feelings about a few of these topics myself, they all deserve a fair hearing, not the thinly-veiled (and worse) threats they’ve endured on campus for the last decade. Bottom line: University leaders have rhetorically painted themselves into corner. If they try crushing dissent, “weighing in,” or preaching about “our values,” they’re going to look even worse than they already do. Indeed, given the mass of Hamas-wear (including a full Hamas cape) I’ve seen at GMU and the University of Texas over the last few weeks, I think you can now get away with discussing any topic you like while wearing any costume you like. Now is your chance — and the chance of every true on-campus dissident. As Treebeard roars at the end of the The Two Towers, “Break the dam! Release the river!” “Break the dam! Release the river!”";912

Response to Sehon on Socialism;https://betonit.substack.com/p/response-to-sehon-on-socialism;"Last month, I debated Bowdoin’s Scott Sehon on socialism. Here’s my reply to his reply to me. Scott’s in blockquotes, I’m not. The definitional question [W]hy do I include the degree of egalitarian redistribution as part of the definition of “socialism”? Because if you had complete collective control or ownership of the means of production, but wildly unequal distribution of resources (which would be entirely possible), that would not be socialism according to any conception of it that I’m aware of. How about every actual socialist dictatorship?! Yes, I know that their officially measured inequality was low, but that’s only because they dishonestly fail to count most of the private consumption of the ruling elite. Kim Jong Un’s palaces obviously aren’t in North Korean inequality statistics. Stalin officially only drew a modest paycheck, but had personal access to any Soviet resources he desired. Maduro feasts while ordinary Venezuelans starve. And that’s just the tip of the inequality iceberg. For most practical purposes, the Kims own North Korea, and Stalin owned the Soviet bloc. You could object, “It’s not possible for one human’s consumption to be so high,” but the same goes for any billionaire. When you’re that rich, you never even see where most of your money goes. Yes, it might turn out that under a system with very little collective control, distribution of resources was largely equal. If there were actual examples of that, then that would be interesting, and it would show that there are governments that, because of the two-dimensional nature of my definition, do not fit neatly into a one-dimensional spectrum of capitalism/socialism. That’s fine. That’s the way two-dimensional characterizations of a term work: they are not one-dimensional. This makes the issue sound totally hypothetical. But several of the main government policies I attacked — especially immigration restrictions and housing regulation — clearly count. Moreover, as I say in the chapter Bryan liked, we shouldn’t argue about words. If someone really wants to deny me the word “socialism” because they define it solely in terms of collective ownership, then that’s up to them. I’d say that they have an oddly idiosyncratic conception of the term, but I won’t argue about the word. Call what I am arguing for “Socialism*” or even “Sehon-socialism” if you want; it matters not, as long as we are clear about how I am using the term. It matters if you’re cutting yourself off from the vast majority of actual historical socialists, no? And it matters if you’re insinuating that actual government interference with capitalism promotes equality, which is debatable at best. Scandinavian countries and the definition Bryan says that I overstate the degree to which Scandinavian countries count as socialist, according to my definition. The Fraser ratings he cites include various factors that are orthogonal to the dimensions that I put as part of my definition—hence my decision not to list them simply as some sort of obvious measure of the degree to which there is collective control of the economy or egalitarian redistribution. It sure seems like all of the Fraser measures are relevant. What’s wrong with them? For that matter, what’s wrong with Johan Norberg’s The Mirage of Swedish Socialism? I’m not a Sweden expert, but if it were my favorite country, I’d definitely want to respond to the most notable experts who claim that my favorite country isn’t what I imagine. But, again, why quibble about words? Suppose Bryan were to grant me this much: “it would be good to go as far as the Scandinavian countries in terms of redistribution and greater collective control; I just wouldn’t count that as socialist.” Then I’d be pretty happy. Yes, I’d suggest going somewhat further, but I’d be happy with that huge concession. Of course, Bryan is not making any such concession, so I’m not sure what the point is of the definitional dispute about whether the Scandinavian countries count as moving in the socialist direction. The point: If you’re right about good Scandinavian outcomes but wrong to believe that they achieved those outcomes because they have much more collective control and egalitarianism, that undermines your case for collective control and egalitarianism. Inequality and data about overall well-being Bryan does not present contrary data showing greater well-being in countries that are more capitalist, but instead questions bits and pieces of my data, and notes in particular that the Scandinavians are not that much happier than people in more capitalist countries. And he questions that the explanation for their happiness has anything to do with the fact that they are further towards socialism… But note this: With all his efforts, Bryan is attempting to explain away data that, on their face, do not fit his thesis and do fit mine. That is hardly a positive case for his implicit claim that more capitalism will lead to greater well-being or that government “is terrible”.  If government is terrible for well-being, then given that the Scandinavians have (by the numbers given above) a lot more government than the United States, then why aren’t they a lot less happy than people in the United States? Reasonable points. Which I why I’m arguing that (a) Scandinavia is, properly measured, only moderately more socialist than the U.S., (b) that the U.S. is actually quite socialist in absolute terms, and (c) that the biggest government interventions in the U.S. (and other First World countries) are much worse than laissez-faire. The ”most frustrating part of the debate” Bryan says that the most frustrating part of the debate was that I kept comparing Scandinavia to the United States instead of comparing his ideal to my ideal.  By way of explanation, let me say two things. 1. I’m not sure what my ideal is. I’m actually being driven by data in saying that more egalitarian distribution and more collective control lead to greater well-being. Various data indicate strongly that we can increase overall well-being by decreasing inequality, and this is hardly surprising given that money has diminishing marginal utility. How far can we go in this direction without, for example, destroying incentives that might be necessary to get people to be productive? That's an empirical question. I think that the data suggest that we can go a fair bit further than the Scandinavian countries, but I don’t know how far. So why do you show so little curiosity about what happened in the Soviet bloc and other counties that did take collective control and egalitarianism (as you measure it) much further? 2. Bryan’s professed ideal (at least the next day in the class session if not in the debate) involved either no government (just privately run police, courts, etc.) or extremely minimal government. We have no data points on any country matching that ideal, because there aren’t any such countries. I’m not frustrated that you didn’t respond to my brief answer to one curious student the day after the debate. I’m frustrated that you didn’t respond to my whole positive case that I did present in the debate. I say there are six massive areas of government regulation and ownership which the evidence strongly shows are terrible: immigration restrictions, housing regulation, universal redistribution, education subsidies, housing subsidies, and the near-ban on nuclear power. Do you really support all six of these? If not, you favor some big moves in a capitalist direction. Rights and socialism Bryan suggests that there is some right to private property or freedom of contract that would be violated by socialism. He doesn’t specify the contours of this right. At one extreme, one might claim that people have the right to keep any property currently in their possession; it would follow from this that it would be a violation of rights for there to be any taxation whatsoever. I wouldn’t say “currently in their possession,” because that would mean that as soon as a thief grabbed something, it would be wrong to take it back. There’s got to be a background theory of justice in acquisition, a la Locke, Nozick, or Rothbard. Is that Bryan’s position? That even if well-being is significantly enhanced by having taxation and government services, that any taxation is a violation of rights and thus should not happen? We did discuss this; remember “weak deontology”? My position is that there is indeed a presumptive right against any taxation, which can be overcome if the net social benefits are large and certain enough. Which is probably your position, too, on freedom of speech, freedom of religion, voting, or any other rights you accept! My challenge: If you accept any rights, why not some property rights, too? Indeed, how meaningful is a right of religion, unless you have a right to own a church? How meaningful is a right of free speech, unless you have a right to own a printing press or AV studio? You must have heard such arguments many times before. Why not address them?";1550
How Socialist is Sweden?;https://betonit.substack.com/p/how-socialist-is-sweden;During our Capitalism versus Socialism debate, Scott Sehon argued that Scandinavia really is quite socialist. Since I’m not on expert on Scandinavia, I asked Johan Norberg, author of the short book The Mirage of Swedish Socialism, as well as the recent The Capitalist Manifesto, to weigh in. Norberg kindly agreed. With great interest I have followed Bryan Caplan’s and Scott Sehon’s capitalism versus socialism debate. I think they do an excellent job outlining their respective positions and their differences (it’s no secret that I am team Caplan). Since so much of the debate has revolved around the accomplishments of Nordic countries, perhaps it would be of interest to hear some thoughts from a Swede, who has just published a study on Sweden’s experience with big government, The Mirage of Swedish Socialism. One of Sehon’s favorite pro-socialism arguments is that Scandinavian welfare states seem to be doing better on many indicators of well-being than the United States. This is a tricky argument, since it’s difficult to find causation when so many variables differ between Scandinavians and Americans. When a Swedish economist once told Milton Friedman that there was no poverty in Sweden, Friedman famously replied: “That’s interesting, because among Scandinavians in America we also have no poverty.” His point was that the millions of descendants of Scandinavian migrants in the US do better than most other Americans, and interestingly, also tend to do better than Scandinavians in Scandinavia. I am not sure if someone has looked into whether they are happier too, but going by my admittedly anecdotal evidence, it wouldn’t surprise me. And it’s by no means certain that economic freedom is the most important difference between our countries. As Caplan points out, on the Fraser Institute’s 10-point scale, the US now registers an economic freedom rate of 8.14, compared to 8.10 for Denmark. (Sweden is at 7.81). At a minimum, this reveals that Scandinavian countries compensate for higher taxes and more public spending by having freer markets in several other areas. Indeed, on other indicators than taxes and spending, Sweden is on average slightly more capitalist than the US. If Scott Sehon wants to imitate Sweden, he would have to liberalize several markets, reform social security and introduce private accounts, introduce school vouchers, get rid of most occupational licensing, introduce budget rules that demand a surplus over a business cycle, abolish inheritance and property taxes, and actually reduce corporate taxes a bit. As the means of production have not been nationalized, Sweden is not a socialist country. With strong protections for property rights, and mostly private companies competing freely in an open economy coordinated by prices set by market forces, it bears little resemblance to Soviet Russia or Venezuela. Public spending is a bit higher than America’s, but not dramatically so. According to the latest OECD data on general government spending, Sweden spends 49.1 percent of GDP compared to 44.9 percent in United States. Social spending is very similar, 23.7 and 22.7 percent of GDP respectively. If America is not an example of socialism, it is difficult to make the case that Sweden is. A country like France is more of a big government outlier, with public spending of 59 percent of GDP and social spending of 31.6 percent. A country, incidentally, with lower self-reported well-being than both US and Sweden. It is also important to understand how Scandinavian welfare states are funded, because it’s easy to get the impression that it’s all about taking from the rich and giving to the poor. And that will always sounds tempting. But that is the opposite of what we do. Sweden has lower corporate taxes than other OECD countries, and no taxes on property, wealth, gifts and inheritance. At the same time Sweden taxes the incomes of the poor heavier than other countries and implements a regressive value-added tax at a normal rate of 25 percent. According to an OECD study, the richest decile in Sweden pays almost exactly the same share in household taxes as their share of market income, while in the US the top decile pays 1.35 times their share of market income. Counter-intuitively, Sweden has one of the least progressive tax systems of all rich countries. This is the result of a painful lesson from the 1970s and 80s, the one era when Sweden really did experiment with socialist ideas. This was also the only time in modern economic history that Sweden lagged behind the rest of the world. When redistribution increased, growth repeatedly disappointed, debts ballooned and not a single net job was created in the private sector for more than two decades. Important entrepreneurs and major corporations like IKEA and Tetra Pak left Sweden. Yes, we became more equal, because of an exodus of rich people — and few new fortunes were created. It all ended in a terrible economic crash in the early 1990s, after which the left and the right agreed to liberalize the economy and stop punishing wealth creation. Swedish social democrats learned that you can have a big government or make the rich pay for it all. You can’t have both. The rich and the entrepreneurial are too few and too important to the economy. Today, the Swedish government is still relatively generous, but we pay for it ourselves, not the least low- and middle-income households. It’s mostly redistribution over the life cycle, not between groups. The major difference between us and the US is not that we get more, but that our government tells us how and when we should spend more of our income. Since Sehon’s case for big government relies so heavily on the fact that Scandinavians report slightly higher subjective well-being than Americans, I would like to conclude by sharing a story from my latest book, The Capitalist Manifesto: The Dutch sociologist Ruut Veenhoven, the man behind the famous “World Database of Happiness”, has told me that when he first began to study happiness, he was active in the Social Democratic party and believed that redistribution and social spending was a key to subjective wellbeing. This was a tempting assumption when you always find countries like Denmark, Finland and Sweden near the top of the happiness lists. But as Veenhoven got more statistics, it became clear that other small, rich democracies such as Iceland, Switzerland and New Zealand, with lower social spending as a share of GDP than the US, were also consistently at the top of the rankings. Ireland, the Netherlands and Australia have about half the social spending that Belgium, Italy and France do, but are significantly happier. “Happiness is not greater in welfare states,” Veenhoven now states, “I was simply wrong.” Another conclusion that surprised Veenhoven was that income inequality does not reduce a country’s well-being: “Income inequality is a by-product of capitalist societies and they have such a positive effect on well-being that it outbalances the negative effect of being relatively poor.” This, Veenhoven adds, is not a popular conclusion in all camps: “My colleagues are not amused. Inequality is big business here in the sociology department. Entire careers have been built on it.”;1219
Hsieh Replies to Greaney;https://betonit.substack.com/p/hsieh-replies-to-greaney;Back in 2021, I noticed some large apparent errors in Chang-Tai Hsieh and Enrico Moretti‘s “Housing Constraints and Spatial Misallocation” (American Economic Journal: Macroeconomics, 2019). Both authors quickly acknowledged that I was correct. Recently, Brian Greaney of the University of Washington posted a totally new critique of Hsieh-Moretti. Greaney’s piece has been getting considerable attention. But this time, the original authors are not conceding error so easily. Hsieh has kindly given me permission to reprint his negative referee report, and here it is. Since there’s a lot of math, I’m screencapping it. Or read the pdf if you prefer.;105

Idealpolitik for Martians;https://betonit.substack.com/p/idealpolitik-for-martians;"Countries almost always claim high motivations: religion, ideology, morality. They strive and — if necessary — they fight for these ideals. Off-camera, however, diplomats, scholars of international relations, and other sophisticated observers roll their eyes. Countries don’t genuinely care about these childish ideals. Their true motivation is hard-boiled national self-interest. Like it or not, what rules international affairs is Realpolitik. Or does it? At least since the dawn of mass media in the late 19th century, I see little sign that “national self-interest” explains much of anything. Realpolitik is far less predictive than its antithesis of Idealpolitik. To grasp my point, imagine trying to explain today’s most-talked-about global conflicts to a Martian. “Humans, why do you fight?” Israel-Palestine. While you could say, “They’re fighting over land,” this raises far more questions than it answers. Why fight at all, the Martian might ask, when one side could just buy the other out, settling the conflict once and for all? You could insist “War is haggling by other means,” but the cumulative financial cost of seventy five years of war far exceeds the actual value of the land. Stranger still, Israel has a massive military advantage, so why didn’t it seize all of the Palestinians’ land long ago? And why didn’t the Palestinians, in turn, see the writing on the wall and meekly surrender? Idealpolitik has the answers. Israelis and Palestinians aren’t just fighting over land; they fighting over land that both sides see as “sacred.” Religiously sacred. Historical sacred. Due to the land’s sacrosanct character, most people on both sides think “selling out” is a sin. The flip side is that fighting for possession of this sacred land is a an act of religious and historical heroism. Financial cost be damned! Why then, the Martian might ask, haven’t the Israelis just utterly crushed the Palestinians? Because the Israelis also have a conflicting set of ideals against genocide or anything close. So while they have the might for final victory, they pull their punches. A lot. Yes, you could add, “If the Israelis tried genocide, they’d face the wrath of the West and the Muslim world.” But that wrath, too, is driven by Idealpolitik — Western support for universal human rights plus global Muslim solidarity. Russia-Ukraine. Again, you could declare, “They’re fighting over land” or “They’re fighting over whether Ukraine has to stay in Russia’s sphere of influence.” Why, though, doesn’t one just buy the other out? Why spend more fighting than the land itself is worth? The Russians claim that Ukraine’s friendship with the West poses an “existential threat,” but if the Martian asked, “How, exactly?” it’s hard to see how they’d even begin to respond. Idealpolitik, in contrast, zeroes in on rival nationalisms. The Russians feel entitled to protect and rule all Russians — and consider many, most, or even all Ukrainians to be Russian. Most Ukrainians, in contrast, see themselves as a distinct — and aggrieved — rival nation. The Russians, moreover, tend to define the West as “their enemy,” so they fear a world where Ukraine joins the Western camp. But it is Russian ideals that drive this definition. Before the war, they could just as easily have defined the West as “their friend,” placated a few Western scruples, and ended the Ukraine conflict before it started. U.S.-China. These two superpowers aren’t even fighting over land; they’re fighting about a hypothetical future fight over land. Given their high volume of trade, you’d expect both sides to say “We’ve got a good thing going” and “Let’s not rock the boat.” Alas, both sides flout expectations. How could you explain this all to a Martian? For two decades, the Americans were optimistic that Chinese development would slowly lead China toward the Americans’ cherished ideals of democracy and human rights. The Chinese, however, stuck with authoritarian nationalism. By 2010 or so, the Americans felt like their glorious ideals had been spurned, and the Chinese felt like their own glorious ideals were being disrespected. Atrocities like the Uighur internment, though materially irrelevant, amplified their mutual idealistic recriminations. Otto von Bismarck, Patron Saint of Realpolitik At this point, the Martian might inquire, “So Idealpolitik works because the leaders of each country are earnestly devoted to their respective ideals?” And this is where things get complicated, because the truth is that humans’ devotion to their ideals is, with rare exceptions, deeply superficial. 99%+ of people who say they’re “ready to die” for religion, ideology, or morality are deceivers or self-deceivers. And thank goodness for that, because virtually all popular “ideals” range from confused to monstrous. Still, in any polity dominated by idealistic rhetoric, the surest path to power is to mummify yourself in popular ideals. And that’s precisely what almost every political leader does. Since power-hunger is a common motive, vocal Idealpolitik hardly guarantees political success. Refusal to practice vocal Idealpolitik, however, almost guarantees political failure. Once they’ve got power, of course, leaders’ pride is on the line, too. To announce, “Our ideals are kind of stupid” is humiliating. Realpolitik remains analytically, though not predictively, useful. In a world of real Realpolitik, countries would durably solve every major dispute with pragmatic bargaining. Even the bargaining would often be unnecessary. When reputation matters, noblesse oblige beats nickel-and-diming: See the return policies of Amazon and CostCo. In a world of Realpolitik, Israelis would just buy up Palestinian land for double its market price, and Palestinians would chirp, “Pleasure doing business with you.” In a world of Realpolitik, Russians never would have invaded Ukraine; why try to beat the West when you can join it? In a world of Realpolitik, the U.S., China, and Taiwan would drop the nonsense of strategic ambiguity. Either Taiwan would pay an exit price, or China would cultivate global good will with “Don’t worry about it, no charge.” The harsh reality that none of this will happen is strong evidence that Idealpolitik and “realism” are, far from opposites, one and the same.";1024
Rufo is Reason;https://betonit.substack.com/p/rufo-is-reason;"If my The Case Against Education is correct, the best education policy is austerity. Lavish education spending spawned dystopian credential inflation; massive education cuts will reverse the damage. In the book, I defend austerity on standard cost-benefit terms: When the social return on an investment is very low, you should invest vastly less. But in other writings, I’ve also defended austerity on libertarian grounds: The less government spends, the more the private sector expands to replace it. In the limit, zero government spending and full privatization are the same thing. What precisely should be cut first? The Case Against Education urges readers to be open to almost any kind of cut. Across-the-board cuts. Raising standards, then refusing to fund students below those standards. Cutting especially useless subjects. And on and on. Still, I’m not naive enough to imagine that government spending on education will vanish anytime soon. What should be done in the meantime? My other big proposed reform in The Case Against Education is to reallocate funding to vocational education due to its higher social return. The general principle: If government is going to spend taxpayer dollars on education, it should spend them well. For example, if you have a choice between funding worthless Zoom school and funding in-person school that at least provides daycare, fund the latter. To belabor the obvious, almost no one agrees with my vision for education reform. In the U.S., only 5% favor lower spending on education. Globally, clear majorities in every country ever surveyed favor more spending on education. Which is why I was deeply pleased to see that Chris Rufo, author of America’s Cultural Revolution and administrator/provocateur at the New College of Florida, does broadly agree with my austerian vision. Here’s his full agenda on “How to Fix Academia,” posted yesterday on X: -Reduce the flow of federal funds to universities -Privatize the student loan market and make colleges partially responsible for student defaults -Abolish DEI bureaucracies -Wind down activist pseudo-disciplines -Reform faculty hiring to restore ideological balance -Punish universities that discriminate on the basis of race -Tie federal funding to upholding standards of civil discourse and debate –Break the accreditation cartel –Turn a limited number of state universities into classical liberal arts academies –Set up recruiting pipelines and employment opportunities for classically-minded scholars –Establish new academic journals outside the existing left-wing circles –Eliminate the requirement to have a master's in education for teaching in K-12 public schools, which will gut the state graduate schools of education –Require state universities to sign the Kalven Statement and refrain from taking political positions as a corporate entity –Require all universities that receive federal funds to provide annual summary statistics for race, sex, GPA, and SAT scores –Enforce standards of civil discourse so that physical violence, intimidation, vandalism, and heckler's vetoes earn immediate suspension or expulsion –Fund internal watchdogs to hunt for academic fraud –Require state-affiliated researchers to preregister research hypotheses and make all data available to the public –Reduce funding for scientific and social-scientific fields that consistently fail to replicate –Legalize intelligence tests for admissions and hiring –Provide high-prestige test-out options for individuals to demonstrate domain knowledge without having to earn a bachelor's degree –Work with employers to screen for capacity, not degrees (an expensive substitute) –Over time, reduce the overall number of placements at four-year universities—which should cater to the top 10% of the most academically gifted—and shift resources to lower-cost trade programs, community colleges, and professional training that provide a better ROI for society –Wind down the repressive Title IX bureaucracy –Significantly reduce the number of administrators and pseudo-therapeutic bureaucracies on campus –Reward colleges financially for a low admin-to-faculty ratio –Give tenured faculty raises as the number of admins is reduced –Allow universities that have been relying on unlimited state loan subsidies (and predatory marketing to high school students) to go bankrupt and then restructure or shut down –Submit the entire sector to greater market discipline –Persuade alumni donors to stop giving This sparked a short followup exchange. Me: Let's also reduce state and local funding while we're at it. Chris: Deal. Me: And libertarians wonder why I like you, Chris! Chris: Read the thread and let me know if you oppose any of these proposals on libertarian grounds. This is such a fun request that I’m going to classify all of his proposals into four categories: Full Support, Better Than the Status Quo, Undecided, and Against, with sporadic commentary in bracketed italics. Full Support -Reduce the flow of federal funds to universities -Privatize the student loan market and make colleges partially responsible for student defaults -Abolish DEI bureaucracies -Wind down activist pseudo-disciplines -Tie federal funding to upholding standards of civil discourse and debate –Eliminate the requirement to have a master's in education for teaching in K-12 public schools, which will gut the state graduate schools of education –Require state universities to sign the Kalven Statement and refrain from taking political positions as a corporate entity –Enforce standards of civil discourse so that physical violence, intimidation, vandalism, and heckler's vetoes earn immediate suspension or expulsion –Reduce funding for scientific and social-scientific fields that consistently fail to replicate –Legalize intelligence tests for admissions and hiring –Provide high-prestige test-out options for individuals to demonstrate domain knowledge without having to earn a bachelor's degree [While I fear that test-out options are inherently low-prestige, the cost savings are so massive that it’s worth a try!] –Over time, reduce the overall number of placements at four-year universities—which should cater to the top 10% of the most academically gifted—and shift resources to lower-cost trade programs, community colleges, and professional training that provide a better ROI for society –Wind down the repressive Title IX bureaucracy –Significantly reduce the number of administrators and pseudo-therapeutic bureaucracies on campus –Allow universities that have been relying on unlimited state loan subsidies (and predatory marketing to high school students) to go bankrupt and then restructure or shut down –Submit the entire sector to greater market discipline –Persuade alumni donors to stop giving [Note: Chris said “persuade”!] Better Than the Status Quo -Reform faculty hiring to restore ideological balance [While this does have a slight risk of pushing a new official orthodoxy, it would be almost impossible to get anything remotely as bad as the official orthodoxy we already endure. It is no exaggeration to say that most existing humanities and social science professors are not scholars, but priests and priestesses of the Church of Wokism.] -Punish universities that discriminate on the basis of race [If Chris just said, “End federal funding for universities that discriminate on the basis of race,” I’d support it. Though I think that the best approach would be to deny federal funding to universities that fail to use a transparent meritocratic admission formula.] Undecided –Break the accreditation cartel [I’m aware of the problems with the status quo. But “breaking the accreditation cartel” could remove one of the main existing restraints on federal funding. At least right now, you can’t get federal money for your unaccredited College of Homeopathy.] –Turn a limited number of state universities into classical liberal arts academies [I’d rather have students study Greeks, Romans, and Shakespeare than Grievance Studies, but I just don’t see much student demand or social return.] –Set up recruiting pipelines and employment opportunities for classically-minded scholars [This is better than recruiting pipelines and employment opportunities for Grievance Studies. But why not just accept that Classics is a noble avocation, instead of making taxpayers fund it? Didn’t Anthony Hopkins’ Titus do more for Shakespeare than the last century of Shakespeare studies?] –Establish new academic journals outside the existing left-wing circles [Sounds good, but we already have a bunch of explicitly non-left journals. The bottleneck is lack of non-left research, not non-left journals to publish such research.] –Require all universities that receive federal funds to provide annual summary statistics for race, sex, GPA, and SAT scores [Wouldn’t it be better if universities just stopped collecting race and sex data?] –Require state-affiliated researchers to preregister research hypotheses and make all data available to the public [Sounds good, but there really is proprietary data. And preregistration is fairly easy to circumvent, so I doubt the extra paperwork is worth it.] –Work with employers to screen for capacity, not degrees (an expensive substitute) [Sounds good, but don’t employers know their own interests best already?] –Reward colleges financially for a low admin-to-faculty ratio [Appealing, but I’m worried this will just lead schools to have admins teach one class a year.] Against –Fund internal watchdogs to hunt for academic fraud [In anything like the current academic environment, this will mostly amount to politically-motivated witch hunts against non-left dissidents.] –Give tenured faculty raises as the number of admins is reduced [Tenured faculty are already grossly overpaid! You might imagine this will get faculty on the side of reform, but that’s highly unlikely. Objective self-interest has almost no effect on people’s political views.] I know Chris Rufo rubs many libertarians the wrong way. Like almost every human, he has spoken rashly on occasion. But on balance, his vision for education reform is radically libertarian and eminently sensible. Sure, you could dwell on minor issues of disagreement. Sure, you could focus on tone policing. But is it not better and wiser to give Rufo full credit for all of the numerous excellent things he says?";1621
Education Policy Party in DC;https://betonit.substack.com/p/education-policy-party-in-dc;When my The Case Against Education released, the American Enterprise Institute was immensely supportive. Rick Hess, its Director of Education Policy Studies, sponsored this fun debate with Eric Hanushek: Nat Malkus, AEI’s Deputy Director of Education Policy Studies, interviewed me as well. The upshot is that I am only too happy to publicize Hess and Malkus’ 2024 Education Policy Academy. If you’re a grad student interested in education, please apply for their small, all-expenses paid workshop in Washington, DC. Does it really count as a party? In my book, yes! Dates: May 20-23, 2024. Details: AEI’s Education Policy Academy is an all-expenses-paid trip to Washington for 20 promising graduate students in education or education-related fields in the first through third years of their studies. Through a series of seminars and working lunches led by experts from across the nation, attendees explore key aspects of how education policy is actually made—from educational leadership to the nuts and bolts of policy tradeoffs and coalition building—in an interactive environment with a diverse group of talented peers. The application window is Monday, November 27–Friday, December 15, 2023. More information, as well as the application, can be found here.;205
LGB Fertility;https://betonit.substack.com/p/lgb-fertility;"Sexual orientation is highly (though not perfectly) heritable. Which is a puzzle for evolutionary psychology. Historically, heterosexual activity was the sole method of human genetic reproduction. Even with assisted reproductive technology, heterosexual activity remains by far the main method of human genetic reproduction. Why, then, haven’t the non-straight genes been wiped out ages ago? The simplest response is to doubt that sexual orientation matters much for fertility. Do we really know? Google Scholar is strangely silent on this issue, but the General Social Survey asks all the required questions to reach an answer. Its fertility question, CHILDS, is pretty clearly about biological children: How many children have you ever had? Please count all that were born alive at any time (including any you had from a previous marriage). Let’s start with the raw averages. Here is male fertility by orientation: Here are the same results for females: (N.B. If respondents’ fertility seems low, remember that the GSS asks about fertility so far. Many respondents are not yet done reproducing; some haven’t even begun). The main result: Fertility differences by orientation are not merely visible, but gargantuan. Gay male fertility is almost 90% lower than straight male fertility. Gay female fertility is almost 75% lower than straight female fertility. Bisexual fertility, for both sexes, is roughly at the midpoint of the two extremes. However, the General Social Survey currently runs from 1972 to 2021. During this time, age-adjusted fertility crashed and non-straight identity skyrocketed. Both long-run trends potentially distort the results. What if we statistically control for both age and year? Here are the regression results for males: Here are the corresponding results for females: For both gay men and women, controlling for age and year only slightly moderate the results. The age-adjusted fertility gap is almost 1.4 children for males and 1.1 children for females, versus raw differences around 1.5 children for males and 1.4 children for females. For bisexuals, in contrast, the age and year adjustments matter more. Bisexual fertility is around .3 children lower for both genders, a deficit less than half of what we see in raw averages. If fertility gaps of this magnitude prevailed historically, it is indeed hard to see how bisexuality, much less homosexuality, persists. The straightforward resolution: The gaps must have been much lower historically due to intense social and family pressure to marry and have children. Now that people in Western societies feel free to be themselves, non-straight genes will take a massive whittling over the next few generations. I am only a messenger. Is there any rival story? The only one of which I am aware is “balancing selection.” The most famous example: Sickle-cell anemia is supposed to survive because one copy of the sickle-cell gene provides helpful malaria resistance, while two copies yield the deadly disease. We can imagine that gay genes work the same way: “Carriers” of gay genes could have higher fertility to offset the ultra-low fertility of actual gays. But this would require markedly higher fertility for gays’ close relatives to explain the facts. Google Scholar has a couple of supportive papers, but the story ultimately seems very far-fetched. Can being gay really cause your siblings to have a combined fertility surplus equal to twice your fertility deficit? How depressed should gays and bisexuals feel about their genetic prognosis? Barely. If you plan to have zero biological kids, you already know that you will pass none of your genes onto the next generation. None of your genes for intelligence. None of your genes for personality. None of your genes for your passions. If none of that bothers you, why should the non-transmission of your genes for sexual orientation tip the scales? Sure, the far future will be very straight, but you won’t be there to feel like something special has been lost.";655
In Defense of a Universal Basic Income;https://betonit.substack.com/p/in-defense-of-a-universal-basic-income;"Chris Freiman, my friend and former Bet On It guest blogger, is an extraordinarily reasonable guy. He also supports the Universal Basic Income, which I regard as a terrible idea. Worse than the status quo! So I asked Chris to write another guest post defending his position. I’ll reply in the near future, then give Chris the last word if he wants it. Here’s Chris: I agree with Bryan that the right question to ask about a universal basic income isn’t whether it’s the best possible option but rather whether it’s better than the status quo. If we replaced the current welfare state with a UBI, would that be an improvement? I think it would be. One major advantage of a UBI over the status quo is that it’s better for recipients. To motivate this idea, suppose your employer gives you the following choice: take your annual $1,000 bonus in cash or receive free lunches at the office with a total value of $1,000. Surely you’d take the bonus in cash. Why? Because if you want the lunches, you can use the cash to buy them. And if you don’t want the lunches, you can use the cash to buy something else. Similarly, someone is better off receiving cash instead of what’s distributed to them by the welfare state because it gives them the flexibility to provide for themselves as they see fit. They can always use that cash to buy the bundle that the welfare state would have distributed to them or they can use it to buy something else that they value more highly. A UBI gives people the freedom to buy the quality and quantity of resources that they themselves deem appropriate for their particular circumstances. Beyond the freedom argument, “findings are generally positive that UBI-type programs alleviate poverty and improve health and education outcomes and that the effects on labor market participation are minimal.” A recent Chris Freiman meme So what about the downsides? Bryan argues that the UBI is wasteful—if you were running your own charity, “you’d target spending to do the most good. And unlike the UBI, the status quo makes some effort to so target its resources.” I’ve got a couple of thoughts here. First, while the status quo does make some effort to target its resources, it doesn’t do a very good job. As Michael Munger points out in Tomorrow 3.0, welfare spending amounts to about $42,000 per family of three in poverty per year, which would be more than enough to lift them above the poverty line if it were distributed to them directly. So a lot of welfare spending simply isn’t reaching those who need it the most. Second, we can make a UBI progressive with adjustments on the tax end. It’s true that even Bill Gates will get a check—and that looks wasteful—but he’ll be paying far more into the UBI than he’ll be getting out. Plus, this consideration should help allay worries about the affordability of a UBI. Bryan raises another concern about UBI’s lack of targeting—those who simply choose not to work will still receive money. And there’s a clear reason to worry about this: it will incentivize people not to work. In reply, I’ll first note that the status quo also generates incentives not to work. Bryan acknowledges this, but points out that “switching to a UBI would expand the familiar perverse effects of the welfare state to the entire population – including you.  And if taxes rise to pay for the UBI, the population-wide disincentives are even worse.” However, a UBI will also improve incentives to work in some cases. To take one example, replacing the status quo with a UBI would eliminate benefit cliffs. A recipient of a benefit faces a “cliff” when they’ll lose more than one dollar’s worth of the benefit upon earning one dollar of income; thus, someone facing a benefit cliff has a strong incentive not to earn that dollar of income. A UBI doesn’t create any cliffs—earning more money won’t reduce your benefits. Of course, it could be that a UBI creates worse incentives than the status quo, all things considered. Yet evidence suggests that we shouldn’t be too worried that a UBI will cause a dramatic drop in employment. As one overview of the effects of a UBI puts it, “The evidence from diverse interventions in low-, middle-, and high-income contexts indicates minimal impact on aggregate measures of labor market participation, with some studies reporting an increase in work participation. When reductions do occur, time is channeled into other valued activities such as caregiving.” There’s a second reason to be concerned about a UBI’s lack of targeting. As Bryan writes, “Forcing people to help others who can’t help themselves – like kids from poor families or the severely disabled – is at least defensible.  Forcing people to help everyone is not.” In brief, while taxing someone to help those unable to work may be just, taxing them to help the person who is perfectly able to work but would prefer to surf (to take an example from Philippe Van Parijs) is not. What, though, should we do about the problem of the surfer? Presumably the way to address it is to restrict access to the money somehow. But this creates a new problem: restrictions will inevitably exclude some people who need the assistance along with those who don’t because they’ll create administrative burdens that make it more difficult to access the benefit. Consider some examples. Work requirements might be imposed to exclude the surfer. But often recipients are unaware of the requirements and face difficulty establishing that they’ve met them. Disability requirements also create significant administrative burdens that reduce recipients’ access to benefits. The Earned Income Tax Credit is meant to help poor families, particularly those with children. But about 1/5th of eligible taxpayers didn’t claim it. While an unconditional income program will distribute money to some who shouldn’t get it, a conditional income program will fail to distribute money to some who should get it. So which should we opt for? I favor the unconditional income program for two reasons. First, as noted above, evidence suggests that a UBI won’t prompt many people to drop out of the workforce to spend their days surfing. Second, and more importantly, it’s worse if someone who needs help doesn’t get help than if someone who doesn’t need help gets help. That is, it’s morally better if both the surfer and the child from a poor family receive assistance than if neither receive assistance.";1140

I Interview Hanania on *The Origins of Woke*;https://betonit.substack.com/p/i-interview-hanania-on-the-origins;[Update: My mother is very sick, so I am postponing Friday’s promised all-access movie and television AMA. My apologies!] Here’s my deep dive interview for Richard Hanania’s new The Origins of Woke: Civil Rights Law, Corporate America, and the Triumph of Identity Politics. Richard and I start with the narcissistic question of whether my critique of his “Why Is Everything Liberal?” personally inspired the entire book. Then I pose a long list of questions, including… 4. Which institutions or factions within institutions now want to enforce wokeness?  Which ones don’t?  How has this changed since 1970 or so? 5. Are there any notable cases where firms are so woke that they don’t try to minimize their own liability in civil rights lawsuits? 6. While writing The Case Against Education, I gradually came to the conclusion that disparate impact law is overrated. Even when IQ-based hiring is legal, it’s rare. Change my mind. 8. My understanding: Almost all discrimination cases are brought by aggrieved employees and former employees.  So hostile work environment >> disparate impact, except perhaps for very prominent firms.  Am I wrong? 9. Hostile work environment law is the main reason why civil rights and civil liberties conflict. This add-on to traditional discrimination law is “The rights that ate all others” and the origin of Hanania’s “lies about lies.”  Also: Let’s talk about the “equal opportunity sexual harassment defense.” 15. On the causes of disparities – can the left really be foolish enough to imagine that discrimination is the sole cause?  Or is this tautological Continental philosophy run amok? 16. Stereotype accuracy – what are the strongest exceptions?  Are there important stereotypes that are even truer than most people think? (Our proposed exceptions may surprise you). 17. My attractiveness hypothetical versus harassment law. And finally… 19. Do many employers secretly want vigorous enforcement of anti-white and anti-male discrimination to overcome internal resistance to meritocracy? Here’s the whole interview. Enjoy! And if you still haven’t read the book, do so.;342
Cope With All Your Might;https://betonit.substack.com/p/cope-with-all-your-might;"Over the last year or two, “cope” has become a bad word. “You don’t have to go to Harvard to get a good job”? Cope. “So what if you don’t become a doctor”? Cope. “Women will like you more when you’re older and more successful”? Cope. If you heavily cope, detractors may even accuse you of being addicted to the novel substance of “copium”: copium (noun): a substance said to have been ingested by those who remain unduly optimistic in the face of defeat or disappointment “Cope” comes with a built-in equivocation. It carries a clear accusation of self-delusion — the pathetic refusal to admit your own failings and failures. Yet you can also deploy it when the so-called “cope” is plainly literally true. Responding to rejection with “There are plenty of fish in the sea” is classic cope — and hard fact. I’m all for squarely facing ugly truths. But the War on Cope goes well beyond this. Its nihilistic goal really is to stigmatize self-encouragement. How is it nihilistic? Here’s how: Disappointment is a major feature of human life, especially if you’re trying to do anything worthwhile. The impulsive reaction to disappointment is to abjectly give up. To mournfully mutter, “What’s the use of trying? What’s the use of anything?” Coping — reframing your plight in a more constructive light — is the foresighted antidote to this impulsive reaction. Let’s get bleak. The harsh reality is that we’re all going to die one day. This fact is, on reflection, extremely disappointing. Much more disappointing than getting rejected by Harvard, failing to get into med school, or getting turned down for a date. You could spend the rest of your life bemoaning your own mortality. What you should do, however, is cope: “I won’t live forever, but I’m going to make ever moment count.” “Life is too precious to waste time feeling sad about things I can’t change.” “My children will live on after me, and their children after them.” and even: “If the pain gets too bad as death nears, I can always kill myself.” “My name is Jaguar Paw. I am a hunter. This is my forest. And my sons will hunt it with their sons after I am gone.” None of these statements negates the fact that dying is bad. But they’re still wise and helpful. And the same goes for the lesser horrors that you’re likely to face. Didn’t get the job you really wanted? You should cope: “There will be other chances to get a job as good or better.” “There are plenty of other occupations I might enjoy.” “At least I’m young and healthy.” and even: “I’m lucky just to live in a First World country.” You know who badly needs enhanced coping skills? Incels. The Incel Wiki has a whole article on the evils of cope. Reading it is like reading a letter from a starving man refusing food. ""If you just work on your personality and keep a positive attitude, you will find a nice girl eventually” is true enough. It was never intended as a 100% guarantee. Instead of stigmatizing coping, we should do the opposite. Even the highest-status humans suffer many bitter disappointments. Should they just give up on life? No? Then what should you? Don’t be afraid to cope. Don’t let anyone make you ashamed to cope. Cope honestly, yes, but cope freely. Cope with all your might!";591
Sehon Responds on Socialism;https://betonit.substack.com/p/sehon-responds-on-socialism;"Here are Scott Sehon’s reflections on our TCU Capitalism versus Socialism Debate, as well as his reaction to my reflections. Printed with his permission. Enjoy! There is so much to say about these questions and Bryan’s points! I’ll be selective, not replying to everything he says, even when I still disagree, and I’ll also try (but mostly fail) to be brief. The definitional question Bryan notes that I define socialism in degrees along two axes, (a) degree of collective control/ownership of the economic means of production and (b) degree of egalitarian distribution of resources. He suggests that it makes more sense only to include (a), since it would be possible that one could have a system on which there was very little collective control but a great deal of equality in distribution of resources. So why do I include the degree of egalitarian redistribution as part of the definition of “socialism”? Because if you had complete collective control or ownership of the means of production, but wildly unequal distribution of resources (which would be entirely possible), that would not be socialism according to any conception of it that I’m aware of. So as a matter of how the word “socialism” is typically used, the axis including degree of egalitarian distribution has to be there. Yes, it might turn out that under a system with very little collective control, distribution of resources was largely equal. If there were actual examples of that, then that would be interesting, and it would show that there are governments that, because of the two-dimensional nature of my definition, do not fit neatly into a one-dimensional spectrum of capitalism/socialism. That’s fine. That’s the way two-dimensional characterizations of a term work: they are not one-dimensional. Moreover, as I say in the chapter Bryan liked, we shouldn’t argue about words. If someone really wants to deny me the word “socialism” because they define it solely in terms of collective ownership, then that’s up to them. I’d say that they have an oddly idiosyncratic conception of the term, but I won’t argue about the word. Call what I am arguing for “Socialism*” or even “Sehon-socialism” if you want; it matters not, as long as we are clear about how I am using the term. Scandinavian countries and the definition Bryan says that I overstate the degree to which Scandinavian countries count as socialist, according to my definition. The Fraser ratings he cites include various factors that are orthogonal to the dimensions that I put as part of my definition—hence my decision not to list them simply as some sort of obvious measure of the degree to which there is collective control of the economy or egalitarian redistribution. In terms of sheer size of government, as measured by government spending as percentage of GDP, here are OECD numbers: General Government Spending as percentage of GDP: Denmark                     54.5% Finland                        56.5% Norway                       49.3% Sweden                       49.3% United States               37.9% On average, the Scandinavian countries thus have 38% higher government spending than the U.S. In terms of the OECD numbers of the percentage of the workforce in the public sector, it is even more dramatic: the Scandinavian countries have 83% more. In terms of regulation, the Fraser report gives the U.S. a ranking of 6th in the world whereas the Nordic countries are much lower (meaning, in terms of the Fraser report, that they have more regulation). It is even more dramatic with respect to labor regulation. I gave numbers concerning inequality levels indicating that, while there is still substantial inequality in the Scandinavian countries, it is far less than the United States. None of the data are perfect and one can quibble about sources and what should be weighed more heavily, but I think it is quite clear that the Scandinavian countries are significantly more in the socialist direction. But, again, why quibble about words? Suppose Bryan were to grant me this much: “it would be good to go as far as the Scandinavian countries in terms of redistribution and greater collective control; I just wouldn’t count that as socialist.” Then I’d be pretty happy. Yes, I’d suggest going somewhat further, but I’d be happy with that huge concession. Of course, Bryan is not making any such concession, so I’m not sure what the point is of the definitional dispute about whether the Scandinavian countries count as moving in the socialist direction. Inequality and data about overall well-being My empirical claim here is that overall well-being is improved when we diminish inequality, and I presented a number of pieces of evidence concerning that, both the World Happiness Report and data about health and social problems, and child well-being. In each case there were clear correlations: people are better off in countries with lower inequality. I can repeat all that data if you like (some of it was presented on slides in the debate, with more of it in the book). Bryan does not present contrary data showing greater well-being in countries that are more capitalist, but instead questions bits and pieces of my data, and notes in particular that the Scandinavians are not that much happier than people in more capitalist countries. And he questions that the explanation for their happiness has anything to do with the fact that they are further towards socialism. There are, of course, reasonable questions one can raise about any broad-scale data like this, and, of course, one can always question any move from correlation to causation. I have much more to say in the book about the data and the inference to an explanatory relation. But note this: With all his efforts, Bryan is attempting to explain away data that, on their face, do not fit his thesis and do fit mine. That is hardly a positive case for his implicit claim that more capitalism will lead to greater well-being or that government “is terrible”.  If government is terrible for well-being, then given that the Scandinavians have (by the numbers given above) a lot more government than the United States, then why aren’t they a lot less happy than people in the United States? Bryan’s thesis about government and redistribution being terrible for well-being would predict the opposite of what we see. Again, he can then try to explain away the data that I presented in the debate, and then could go on to try to explain away the further data I present in the book. At some point in these efforts, it starts to look like Bryan’s belief that redistribution and collective control lead to less well-being is more akin to an article of faith rather than an empirically supported hypothesis. The ”most frustrating part of the debate” Bryan says that the most frustrating part of the debate was that I kept comparing Scandinavia to the United States instead of comparing his ideal to my ideal.  By way of explanation, let me say two things. 1. I’m not sure what my ideal is. I’m actually being driven by data in saying that more egalitarian distribution and more collective control lead to greater well-being. Various data indicate strongly that we can increase overall well-being by decreasing inequality, and this is hardly surprising given that money has diminishing marginal utility. How far can we go in this direction without, for example, destroying incentives that might be necessary to get people to be productive? That's an empirical question. I think that the data suggest that we can go a fair bit further than the Scandinavian countries, but I don’t know how far. It may be frustrating to Bryan that I don’t know how far we should go and thus don’t have a preconceived ideal, but it seems that my approach at least has the virtue of intellectual honesty and humility: I’m looking at data and adjusting my theory, rather than having a preconceived ideal and then explaining away contrary data. 2. Bryan’s professed ideal (at least the next day in the class session if not in the debate) involved either no government (just privately run police, courts, etc.) or extremely minimal government. We have no data points on any country matching that ideal, because there aren’t any such countries. We do have the data indicating that countries that have less redistribution have more problems and are unhappier, so that would seem to indicate that if we went even further to Bryan’s extreme, we could extrapolate and infer that we would then have less happiness and well-being. I also make some general arguments in the book to the effect that there are various areas of economic activity where the positive arguments given for the effectiveness of markets clearly fail, and that too would indicate that Bryan’s extreme ideal would lead to less well-being. But the fact remains that we have no direct data on countries that try Bryan’s model—certainly none that I am aware of or that Bryan presented. Rights and socialism Bryan suggests that there is some right to private property or freedom of contract that would be violated by socialism. He doesn’t specify the contours of this right. At one extreme, one might claim that people have the right to keep any property currently in their possession; it would follow from this that it would be a violation of rights for there to be any taxation whatsoever. Is that Bryan’s position? That even if well-being is significantly enhanced by having taxation and government services, that any taxation is a violation of rights and thus should not happen? Or is he proposing some more carefully circumscribed property right that would still allow states to impose some taxes? I don’t know. Different replies would be in order depending on the position he takes. So I won’t say more here, though I can point you to a detailed discussion of rights in chapters 3 and 4 of my book. Like Bryan, I will reiterate thanks to the organizers of the debate, Sam Arnold and Rob Garnett. And I would thank Bryan, both for a productive and honest interchange of ideas and for posting this reply.";1739
Paternalism vs. Social Desirability Bias;https://betonit.substack.com/p/paternalism-vs-social-desirability;Why should misinformation be illegal? The standard story is that agents of deceit, often funded by evil governments and political movements, are manipulating innocent citizens into believing their lies. We need government to foil their nefarious plans. Why should narcotics be illegal? The standard story is that drug dealers, motivated solely by greed, are seducing innocent people into buying their deadly and addictive wares. Again, we need government to foil their nefarious plans. While should high-risk work be illegal? The standard story is that callous employers, hungry for profit, prey on vulnerable people to staff their hellish factories and mines. Who alone can foil their nefarious plans? You guessed it: Government. In all three cases, there is an obvious plot hole in the standard story. Namely: The “victims” all possess straightforward ways to solve their own problems with no government assistance whatsoever! Don’t want to be brainwashed by “misinformation”? Then don’t listen to “alternative voices” — and roll your eyes whenever you hear them. Tell yourself: “Some rando on Twitter says that vaccines kill. What does that prove? Nothing.” Don’t want to consume deadly and addictive narcotics? Don’t buy them. Don’t try them. Tell yourself: “A brief period of euphoria isn’t worth the risk.” Don’t want to perish in a Dickensian factory or mine? Don’t apply for such a job. Don’t accept one if offered. Tell yourself: “I don’t need the money that badly.” If you support the War on Misinformation, the War on Drugs, or the War on Dickensian Employment, you will scoff at the futility of these self-help remedies. But why? The honest response: “Sure, your self-help remedies would work if tried. But the people we’re trying to help won’t use them. So government has to pick up the slack.” This, however, just pushes the question back a step. Why won’t the people we’re trying to help use these self-help remedies? At this point, proponents of the Wars on Misinformation, Drugs, and Dickensian Employment usually start changing the subject. Even though the following cogent rationale for their position should be on the tips of their tongues: The people we’re trying to help won’t solve their own problems because they’re a bunch of idiots! They haven’t a clue about their own best interests, so we coerce these irrational, stupid, moronic, impulsive adults for their own good. The cogent rationale, in a word, is pure paternalism: Since a lot of adults act like children, we shall treat them like children. Why, though, is it so hard to get supporters of such policies to come out and embrace the cogent rationale? It can’t be because the rationale is implausible. Open your eyes: A lot of adults do act like children. Verily, idiots abound. The trouble isn’t substantive, but rhetorical. “Idiots abound,” though true, is an ugly truth. And as the whole literature on Social Desirability Bias teaches us, when the truth is ugly, psychologically normal human beings lie. The harsh reality is that “misinformation” flourishes because lots of people relish crackpots, kooks, and conspiracies theories — and don’t worry much about accuracy. The harsh reality is that narcotics exist because lots of people love getting high — and don’t worry much about tomorrow. The harsh reality is that lots of people want to make money fast — and assume workplace mutilations will happen to someone other than themselves. The harsh reality is that the vast majority of vendors who profit from misinformation, narcotics, and dangerous jobs would find another line of work if they lost their customers. Why can’t supporters of paternalism be honest? The harsh reality is that if they defended their favored policies honestly, support would crash. “Let’s help victims of greedy criminals” makes you sound like a hero to typical voter. “Let’s protect a bunch of total idiots from their own total idiocy” makes you sound like a villain to the typical voter. And in the demagogic world of politics, an intellectually dishonest politician who sounds like a hero crushes an intellectually honest politician who sounds like a villain. Libertarians and free-market economists normally abjure Social Desirability Bias: “Just the facts, ma’am.” When they confront paternalists, however, libertarians and free-market economists often instinctively weaponize Social Desirability Bias. Rhetorically, the easiest way to “refute” paternalism is not to defend the human right to make your own mistakes, but to attack the paternalists personally. With intense sarcasm. “Oh, so you’re the person who knows what everyone should watch.” “Oh, so you’re the person who knows how everyone should live their lives.” “Oh, so you’re the person who knows what jobs everyone should do.” If the paternalists are in any way hypocritical, even better! “Oh, so you’re the person who knows what everyone should watch, even though you watch [some idiot].” “Oh, so you’re the person who knows how everyone should live their lives, even though you’ve been to rehab.” “Oh, so you’re the person who knows what jobs everyone should do, even though you own stock in a mine in Equatorial Guinea.” In a world free of Social Desirability Bias, paternalists and anti-paternalists would stop dancing around the real issue. Paternalists would identify large swathes of humanity as idiots in need of government protection. They’d stop scapegoating suppliers for meeting consumer demand. Anti-paternalists, in turn, would either (a) Defend the right to live idiotically, or (b) Argue that the paternalists are exaggerating the idiots’ idiocy. Alas, that’s not the world we live in.;942
Singer's Noble Lie Revisited;https://betonit.substack.com/p/singers-noble-lie-revisited;"Podcaster Joe Walker recently interviewed Peter Singer for his podcast - and wound up confirming my “noble lie” explanation for Singer’s moral revisionism. Excerpt reprinted with Walker’s permission. WALKER: Fair enough. Okay, some questions about esoteric morality.  So you have this really interesting paper with de Lazari-Radek called, “Secrecy in Consequentialism: A Defence of Esoteric Morality,” which actually Bryan Caplan brought to my attention after you had a recent debate with him.  SINGER: But you're not promoting our book, The Point of View of the Universe. Because, again, that's a paper that we developed, and it has an entire chapter in that book.  WALKER: Yeah, of course.  SINGER: So those who want to read all of these interesting things you are talking about, please order The Point of View of the Universe.  WALKER: Yeah, exactly. Great book for anyone interested in these issues!  SINGER: Thank you, thank you [laughs].  WALKER: Could you briefly outline the broad argument of the paper, and then I'll ask some specific questions.  SINGER: Sure. And this also takes its lead from something that Sidgwick wrote in The Methods of Ethics. And the question here is: to what extent should a utilitarian follow generally accepted moral rules?  That's a large debate that's been going on for some time between utilitarians and opponents who say that there are moral rules that we ought to keep. And utilitarians like Sidgwick want to say, “No, you shouldn't stick to a moral rule no matter what the circumstances. There could be cases where you should break even generally accepted moral rules.” But moral rules do, in general, tend to lead us to make sound decisions. So utilitarians don't think that in absolutely every decision you make, you should always try and calculate the consequences from scratch. They would say, let's say, you're walking down the street near your home, and a stranger comes up to you and says, “Can you tell me where the nearest train station is?” And you know this very well, so you should tell the stranger where the nearest train station is. That will normally be a good thing to do. You could, of course, lie. And you could say the train station is thataway, when you know that's the opposite direction. But why would you do that? Generally speaking, helping strangers who ask for information does good. So you don't have to try and do those calculations.  But there are some circumstances in which you might produce better consequences by not following a rule. The problem with saying to a utilitarian, “Don't follow the rule” in these circumstances is that it might weaken trust in the rule or it might weaken respect for the rule. So if other people know that utilitarians are going around breaking rules all the time, then maybe that will lead to a worse state overall, because people will break rules when they really shouldn't be breaking rules, or break rules for their own convenience, or because of some irrelevant emotion that they have at the time. And that won't be a good thing.  So Sidgwick then raises the question: what should utilitarians do in circumstances where you could do more good if you break the rule, except for the fact that you will weaken support for the rule, and that will be a larger bad consequence than the good consequence that you'd achieve by breaking the rule?  And Sidgwick then says, “Well, sometimes it may be the case that you can only do good if you can keep what you're doing secret.” So this is what's known as esoteric morality: the idea that sometimes you should do something, and the fact that it's the right thing to do will be true if you can keep it secret, but if you can't keep it a secret it won't be the right thing to do. So that's essentially the sense of keeping morality esoteric.  And that's been a controversial doctrine for Sidgwick. And it’s another point in which utilitarians, and Sidgwick in particular, were attacked by Bernard Williams, because Bernard Williams refers to this as “government house morality.” What he means by that is: government house in the heyday, let's say, of the British Empire, where the British colonised various peoples in other parts of the world. And you imagine them living in their nice white-painted Victorian-style government house building, making rules for the betterment of the “natives” of those people and saying, “Well, of course, they're rather simple people, they don't really know what's the best thing to do. So we need to make some rules which apply to them. And we’ll educate them or bring them up, if you like, indoctrinate them into believing that these are the right thing to do. But of course, for us sophisticated government bureaucrats, we will know that, actually, it's not always the right thing to do. And we will sometimes break those rules ourselves in the general good, where we wouldn't actually tell the local people that we're breaking those rules, because then they would not keep the rules that would be best if they do keep.”  So essentially, Williams is saying, this idea of esoteric morality divides people into the uneducated masses, who have to be brought up with simple rules, and the more powerful elites, who think that the rules don't apply to them. And that's obviously an unpleasant way to view morality.  In the article that you mentioned, and then also in the chapter in The Point of View of the Universe, Katarzyna and I defend Sidgwick and say that of course, the whole attitude that Williams is talking about — of the idea that our nation (white people, presumably) have the right to rule over others, and are wiser than they are, and know more about their situation than they do — is objectionable. But that is not an inherent part of esoteric morality. There may be many circumstances in which you don't have those assumptions. But it's still the case that, generally, you ought to breach some rule where it would still be better if other people did not know about the breach of the rule. And therefore the confidence in the rule was weakened.  WALKER: Thank you. So some specific questions.  In the paper, you consider the standard, originally proposed in your famous paper 'Famine, Affluence, and Morality' — the standard that people should give everything they can spare to the global poor. But you and Katarzyna write: ”Perhaps advocating so demanding a standard will just make people cynical about morality as a whole. If that is what it takes to live ethically, they may say, ‘Let's just forget about ethics and just have fun.’ If, however, we were to promote the idea that living ethically involves donating, say, 10% of your income to the poor, we may get better results.”  So, am I correct in thinking that the 10% recommendation is just a straight up example of esoteric morality? And because this is only audio and we're not doing video, if you want to imply the opposite meaning of your verbal answer, just give me a wink.  SINGER: [laughs] Okay, no winks. I don't need to get winks here. And because this has been a fairly sophisticated philosophical discussion, I'm going to assume that the people who have listened to this point — and I'm relying on you not to put this upfront as the very first thing in the program — I'm assuming that people who listen to this point can follow the idea that, yes, we may want to promote a standard in general that is a reasonably simple standard, that is one that's easy to remember, that also picks up various religious traditions about the tithe (10% of your income donated to the poor), and that encourages people to do that, rather than produce a more demanding standard, which will (as in the quote you read) mean that fewer people actually follow it. And even though there are some people who then give significantly more than 10%, the total amount raised for people in extreme need is less than it would be if we'd promoted the 10% standard.  So if that is the case — and obviously it's a factual assumption whether it is the case — then I do think that that's an example of esoteric morality that, yeah, we will say, “Give 10%,” and many people will do that. But if people really want to inquire and think about this and challenge us and say, “Well, why 10%? I could give 20%, and that would do more good. I could give 40% and that would do still more good.” Then we'll be prepared to say, “Alright, so since you have thought through this and not just accepted the 10% guideline, then we'll acknowledge to you that this guideline was done for general acceptance to produce the most good, but if you understand the situation, and you are prepared to do more than 10%, great. Then you should do more than 10%.”  Let me say, by the way, that I haven't myself — certainly not in the last few years — endorsed the 10% guideline. I did talk about it, I think, at one stage many years ago. But in the book, The Life You Can Save (which your listeners can download free from the website of thelifeyoucansave.org), at the back of the book, I have a kind of a progressive table, that's more like an income tax table, that starts with something much lower than 10% for people who are really on fairly low incomes but still have a little bit more than they need, and goes up to 33.3% (a third of your income) for people who are really earning a lot. And essentially, even that 33.3%, I think people who are very wealthy ought to be giving more than that. But what I'm doing is, anyway, a step towards what I think people should really be doing; a step closer to that than just the 10% figure.  WALKER: So my next question is an empirical question. I see a possible tension between your approach to giving to the global poor and your approach to the treatment of animals. So with respect to animals, one could argue that the meat boycott you called for in Animal Liberation was a very demanding standard. And maybe it was better to just encourage people into pescetarianism, or something else, to avoid the greater evil of intensive farming. But instead, you went pretty hard in calling for a meat boycott. So why does giving to the global poor fall into the more esoteric bucket? Because I can see plenty of reasons why you might actually get better outcomes by publicly and consistently calling for the more demanding standard. I can also think of historical examples where that has been successful. For example, maybe you could view the abolition of slavery, as an example of where people kind of radically self-sacrificed over quite a short period of time.  SINGER: It's an interesting question. Because one difference between these is that with giving to the poor, there just is a continuum right? There's no reason why you should use 10% rather than 11%, or 11% rather than 12%. It's a constant continuum. Whereas with slavery, to take that example, freeing the slaves is a demand that you can make, and that ends the evil you're trying to combat. Whereas reducing slavery, while it would do some good, still leaves this problem, essentially, as it was. And the other thing you have to remember about the abolition of the slave trade, or of slavery in general, is that there was never universal support for slavery. And this is a difference from… getting now to the animal issue.  For example, when British ships were transporting slaves from Africa to the United States, slavery was not legal in Britain. And if somebody who was a slave landed in Britain, they were free. And in the United States, where the slaves were going, slavery was, of course, not universally accepted in the United States. It was accepted in the southern states, basically. And the northern states opposed it. So I think the demand to end slavery was a demand that always had a good prospect of success. The demand to give enough money to end poverty is much more difficult. And as I said, there are endless degrees. And in some sense there will no doubt always be some people who have less resources than others.  With animals, the differences go both ways. Because as I said, there is certainly a very clear majority, and even overwhelming majority, accepting the consumption of animals, of meat. And that makes a particular problem.  There is something like, you could imagine, the abolition of slavery, the ending of this problem. But because we're always going to be interacting with animals, there’ll always be questions of conflicts of our interests and their interests, so it's hard to imagine that we're ever going to get completely to a situation that resembles the abolition of slavery. Although we could certainly get a lot closer to it.  You also raise the question of how demanding it is to ask people not to eat meat. At the time I wrote Animal Liberation, I had stopped eating meat, as had my wife. We made this a joint decision. And we didn't find it particularly difficult, I have to say. Or in a way, the main difficulty was that you had to keep explaining this to people and justifying what you're doing. And some of your friends would look at you, as if you'd become a crank. There were kind of those social difficulties. But in terms of having enjoyable meals, cuisines that we love to cook, and feeling good on a vegetarian diet, feeling perfectly healthy, and zestful, all the rest of it, there was no problem at all. So to me, that's actually not so demanding an ask. Maybe it's a more demanding ask than asking reasonably comfortably off people to give 10% of their income to the poor. But it's not much more demanding than that. And it's certainly less demanding than giving a larger sum.  WALKER: But within a consequentialist framework, you might get better results just arguing for pescetarianism or something like that.  SINGER: Well, pescetarian, I don't think is a good example. Because I think…  WALKER: Fish suffer greatly.  SINGER: Fish definitely suffer. And because they tend to be small, there are more of them suffering. You're going to eat more of them. In a way, I think you could argue that, just from the animal welfare point of view — let's put climate change reasons for being vegetarian aside for the moment — from an animal welfare point of view, it's better to eat cows than fish, because one cow can feed quite a few people, and especially if the cows have reasonably good lives. Whereas with fish, either they're coming out of aquaculture, which is just factory farming for fish, and I think they have pretty terrible lives. Or they're scooped out of the oceans, in which case, their lives were good, their deaths were horrible, and there's a lot of overfishing going on, and we're running down a sustainable fish stock.  WALKER: Okay, interesting. I accept that. So let me ask you a few more questions about esoteric morality. So if esoteric morality is a necessary part of a consequentialist theory, that implies that there must be some cap on the optimal proportion of consequentialists in the population, correct, that would be short of 100%? Because if everyone was a consequentialist, and therefore knew that everyone else would practise esoteric morality, that would potentially lead to a degradation in trust, which would be a bad outcome. So in light of esoteric morality, there is an optimal number of consequentialists.  SINGER: I think the point about esoteric morality works in a society where not everyone is a consequentialist and some people believe in certain moral rules and follow those rules because they think that they are kind of right. And you don't want to weaken that trust. Because if you did, they might just become egoists, for example. They might just think about their own interests.  If, on the other hand, you accept the possibility that everyone is a utilitarian, I don't think the situation is the same. Because if you really believe that everybody — or even virtually everybody, so if you meet a stranger, it's overwhelmingly probable that they're utilitarian — then there's a sense in which you can trust them; you can trust them to do the most good. Now, if you ask them to promise that they will meet you at a certain place at noon tomorrow, it's true that you can't trust that they will turn up there because if there is a greater utility and them doing something else, then they will do something else. That's true. But you will want them to do something else because you are a utilitarian. Now that we all have mobile phones, of course, you would expect them to call you up and say, “Sorry, I can't meet you as we arranged because I've got to drive a sick person to hospital,” or whatever else it might be. But I don't think that there is a limit if you assume that everybody could function well as a utilitarian.  WALKER: Okay, interesting. So there's like this valley, where as the proportion of utilitarians increases, trust diminishes. But then at a certain point, trust starts to increase again.  SINGER: Yes, and the benefits then overcome the disadvantages.  WALKER: Okay. So, this is kind of an empirical question, but at what point would you start to worry about trends like the spread of atheism and “WEIRDness”, to use Joe Henrich’s acronym, that kind of potentially drive consequentialism?  SINGER: I don't accept the acronym that consequentialism is weird.  WALKER: But you know that it means Western, Educated, Industrialised, Rich and Democratic?  SINGER: Yes.  WALKER: The Western kind of psychology, isn't that kind of correlated with utilitarianism in a way?  SINGER: I don't think so, actually. I think utilitarianism is a more universal tendency. There's a little book that, again, Katarzyna and I wrote in the Oxford University Press’ Very Short Introductions series, A Very Short Introduction to Utilitarianism, in which we regard Mozi, the Chinese philosopher from the Warring States, as likely to be a utilitarian, although we don't have a lot of extant writings of his. But there seems to be a utilitarian tendency in his thinking. Among the Greeks, there were some people with a utilitarian tendency. Certainly, Epicurus was a hedonist (not necessarily a universal hedonist), but hedonism was about maximising pleasure and minimising pain and has been around for a long time. There's some tendencies in Buddhist thinking, I think, towards reducing suffering and improving happiness. So I think there are utilitarian tendencies that are non-western.  WALKER: Your paper got me wondering whether the Effective Altruism movement is not being consequentialist enough in light of esoteric morality. So to explain what I mean, I think that a lot of scientific and intellectual breakthroughs come about through irrational optimism — people just irrationally persisting and solving a problem that doesn't seem obvious to their contemporaries. Many such cases of this. And one concern I have about the EA movement is that if it uses base rates to give people career advice, it might persuade some people not to work on things that could turn out to be really important. So here, my claim is that EA gives advice that's rational for the individual, but collectively could result in worse outcomes. So, perhaps from the perspective of esoteric morality, there may be cases where EA should not push “the outside view"" (to use Daniel Kahneman’s term) when giving career advice. Do you have a reaction to that?  SINGER: You might be right. I don't really know how you would calculate how often you will get those extraordinary benefits from people pursuing these strange obsessions. But yeah, it is an empirical question. And it's possible that you're right. And if you're right, then, yes, effective altruists should not be persuading people to go for what has the best strike average.  WALKER: So esoteric morality is related to this idea of Straussianism. if we think about Strauss' book, Persecution and the Art of Writing, where philosophers write very cryptically for an audience. Their work may be published more broadly, but only a very select few can actually understand and interpret what they're trying to say, in order to avoid persecution by sort of conveying and discussing uncomfortable truths throughout history.  When I think of examples of noble lies, I can really only call to mind examples of where the noble lie kind of blows up in the face of the liar. Things like at the beginning of the pandemic, when the US Surgeon General told people that masks aren't effective in preventing the spread, because, potentially, they wanted to reserve the supplies of masks for medical professionals. And then that's just seemed to diminish trust in institutions even further in the US. Maybe the only reason I can think of bad examples of noble lies blowing up is because the good ones, by definition, stay hidden. But I'm curious whether you are aware of any historical examples of where Straussianism has worked successfully, on the part of philosophers or anyone else — someone who's tried to be esoteric in their circumstances, they were successful, and now with the benefit of hindsight, we can recognise what they were trying to do.  SINGER: Oh, that's a very good question. I'm not sure that I can think of that off the top of my head. So when you start talking about Straussians, then what I think about actually is the group around George W. Bush, who acknowledged the influence of Strauss. And I think that led them into the catastrophic invasion of Iraq. I think some of them at least knew that Saddam did not have weapons of mass destruction, but they thought that they could create a democracy in the Middle East, and that that would be a good thing and would increase American influence. So that certainly is not what you're looking for. That's an example of it coming very badly unstuck. There surely are examples of noble lies that have worked.";3859
Let's Ban Discrimination: A Socratic Dialogue;https://betonit.substack.com/p/lets-ban-discrimination-a-socratic;"[Backstory: Soon before his trial, Socrates bumps into his frenemy Leonidas in the Athens city square. After exchanging pleasantries, Leonidas notices a group of Egyptian street-sweepers.] Leonidas: Can you believe the monstrous way we Greeks treat the Egyptians? Socrates: Maybe. What is the monstrous way we Greeks treat the Egyptians? Leonidas: Greek employers horribly discriminate against them in hiring. Socrates: Such a relief. I thought we were enslaving them. Leonidas: Not lately, no. But we might as well enslave them. Egyptians are stuck doing the very worst jobs in our society. Socrates: So workers with the very worst jobs happen to toil under our least-unfair employers? Most strange. Leonidas: [frustrated] I’m not even going to engage that, Socrates. You’re ignoring my central point. Socrates: Namely? Leonidas: That the average Egyptian worker endures horrible discrimination at Greek hands. Socrates: How do you know that? Leonidas: Open your eyes! [He waves in the direction of the street-sweepers.] Egyptians are much more likely to do hard, low-paid jobs than Greeks. Socrates: Agreed. How, though, does that show “discrimination”? Leonidas: [stunned] Isn’t it obvious? Socrates: Hardly. Suppose the two of us were standing at the finish line of a marathon, keeping time. Leonidas: Very well. Socrates: Suppose further than out of the first hundred runners in the race, only two are Egyptian. One possible explanation for their poor performance, granted, is “discrimination.” For example, the judges could give Egyptian competitors unfavorable starting positions. But there are plainly other ways to account for their subpar performance. Leonidas: Such as…? Socrates: You tell me. Leonidas: Perhaps… Greeks practice running more. We “try harder.” Socrates: We did invent the marathon, after all. Can you think of any other explanations? Leonidas: Well, uh… Socrates: I promise I won’t repeat a word you say. Leonidas: [grumpily] I guess you could say that Greeks just have more running ability. Socrates: A distinct possibility. Leonidas: So you’re justifying the mistreatment of Egyptian workers? Socrates: Not at all. I’m trying to discover the extent to which Egyptian workers are mistreated. Leonidas: You’re heartless, Socrates. Socrates: Perhaps I am. Yet my fear, Leonidas, is that you are being reckless. Leonidas: Me, reckless?! Socrates: If three men were suspected of murder, would you interview only one? Leonidas: Of course not. Socrates: Suppose you discovered that the first suspect had a hand in the crime. Would you close the investigation? Leonidas: Again, no. Socrates: Why not? Leonidas: [rolling his eyes] Because the first man might have committed the murder in concert with one or both of the other suspects. Socrates: Would you call an investigator who ignored this possibilities “reckless”? Leonidas: [weary] Yes, Socrates. Socrates: What if, similarly, there are three possible explanations for Egyptians’ poor labor performance in the labor market? Should you investigate each? Leonidas: If you insist, Socrates. Socrates: Should you investigate the possibility that each of the three possible explanations is partly responsible? Leonidas: Your analogy is broken, Socrates. Socrates: Ah, then kindly repair it. Leonidas: This is more like a case where we see one man murder another in broad daylight. Go to any place of business —and behold the mistreatment of Egyptians with your own eyes. Socrates: Very well, suppose you’re correct. What should be done to correct this grave injustice? Leonidas: Let’s ban discrimination. Socrates: Who is the “us”? Leonidas: Why, we Greeks, of course. Socrates: And how exactly shall we effect the ban? Leonidas: The quality of our Greek judicial system is famous throughout the world, Socrates. Socrates: A great comfort; I’m coming to trial soon myself! Leonidas: Your case will probably be thrown out of court any day. Socrates: As you say, Leonidas. But please walk me through the legal process you propose. Leonidas: ‘Twould be a delight. In my system, any Egyptian will have a right to sue any employer for discrimination. If convicted, the employer will not only be required to give the Egyptian the job he deserves. He will also owe him a large pile of drachmas to compensate him for insult and injury. We can do it, Socrates. Let’s ban discrimination. Socrates: I understand. And who will decide whether the accused is guilty? Leonidas: I thought you were a learned man, Socrates. Who decides guilt? The same people who decide in any case: the jury. Socrates: The jurors will be Egyptians? Leonidas: [pause] Rarely. Egyptians are, after all, a minority of our society. Socrates: So when an Egyptian accuses a Greek employer of discrimination, Greek jurors will normally adjudicate his guilt? Leonidas: I see no alternative. Socrates: I see several, but let’s stick with your proposal. Why, in your view, do Greek employers so pervasively discriminate against Egyptians? Leonidas: Because they are wicked. Unfair. Full of hate against the Egyptian people. Socrates: Such nefarious motives arise because they are employers? Leonidas: [puzzled] No, Socrates. Because they are Greeks in a Greek supremacist society. Socrates: So the same immoral motives drive the average Greek? Leonidas: That’s Greek supremacy for you. Socrates: Leonidas, could you please remind me how our system selects jurors? Leonidas: Randomly. By lot. That’s what makes it fair. Socrates: So the jurors will, like employers, be “wicked, unfair, and full of hate against the Egyptian people”? Leonidas: It’s possible, but unlikely. Socrates: It is “unlikely” that most people randomly selected from a “Greek supremacist” population will be Greek supremacists? Though I’m no mathematician, I can’t help but believe the opposite. Leonidas: You’re being facile, Socrates. Serving on a jury elevates one’s judgment. Socrates: While hiring and managing employees does not? Leonidas: [self-satisfied] Correct. Hiring and managing employees degrades one’s judgment. Socrates: Quite odd. Leonidas: How so, Socrates? Socrates: Picture an excellent Egyptian worker. An employer discriminates against him. If a juror acquits the employer, what does the juror lose? Leonidas: The satisfaction of righting a grave wrong? Socrates: Very well. And when the employer discriminated against the worker, what did he lose? Leonidas: [wary] The satisfaction of doing the right thing? Socrates: Did he not also lose the profit of hiring an excellent worker? Leonidas: Yes, that too. Socrates: So when they tolerate discrimination, both jurors and employers forego moral satisfaction. But only employers suffer financially. Leonidas: That seems correct. Socrates: Now picture an incompetent Egyptian worker. An employer judges him fairly, but he takes advantage of your discrimination ban to sue his employer for discrimination. Leonidas: No system is perfect, Socrates. People also falsely accuse others of murder, let you still support laws against murder, do you not? Socrates: Bear with me, Leonidas; I’m making a different point. My hypothetical Egyptian comes to court with his false accusation. What does the jury lose if it convicts the employer anyway? Leonidas: Again, it loses the satisfaction of righting a grave wrong. Socrates: Will it, though? The jury could feel righteous self-satisfaction even if the employer is, in fact, innocent. Leonidas: A rather pessimistic view, Socrates. Socrates: Perhaps, but let’s continue. When the employer refused in good conscience to hire the incompetent Egyptian worker fairly, what did he lose? Leonidas: [confused] Nothing? Socrates: Well, he still pays the damages awarded by the jury, no? And may even be required to hire or promote the incompetent worker as well. Leonidas: Where are you going with all this, Socrates? Socrates: You grow impatient with our conversation? Leonidas: [frankly] I do. Socrates: Very well. You condemn our society as “Greek supremacist,” then propose a system where overwhelmingly Greek jurors decide whether overwhelmingly Greek employers discriminate against Egyptian workers. If you’re right about our society, I don’t see how “banning discrimination” helps. Jurors will just rule in favor of employers regardless of the facts. Leonidas: You’re oversimplifying, Socrates. Socrates: Perhaps, but you did ask me to get to the point. Leonidas: Then get to it. Socrates: To repeat: If you’re right about our society, you’re proposal won’t help. Leonidas: Well, perhaps I’m wrong about our society. I’m Greek, and I care about Egyptians. I’m hardly alone. Socrates: That’s when the analysis gets interesting. Suppose an employer says, “I didn’t discriminate,” but a jury says, “Yes, you did.” Why should we side with the jury rather than the employer? Leonidas: [exasperated] Because the jurors are the disinterested parties, of course! Socrates: Both jurors and employers potentially gain moral satisfaction from doing the right thing, no? Leonidas: Yes, but at least the jurors aren’t motivated by financial gain. Socrates: Now I’m truly confused. Leonidas: What now, Socrates? Socrates: Early on, we named three possible explanations for Egyptians’ lack of success. Discrimination was one. Lower effort was another. Lower ability was the third. Leonidas: Back to that, are we? Socrates: We also agreed that, financially speaking, an employer’s best path is to judge workers on their merits. When a jury finds an employer guilty of discrimination, that’s another way of stating, “The defendant failed to maximize profits.” Leonidas: Alright. Socrates: Now consider. Suppose two men are arguing about whether a business decision is prudent. One proverbially has “skin in the game.” His own fortune is on the line. The other is an inexperienced observer. Which of the two is more “disinterested”? Leonidas: The latter. Socrates: Yet whose judgment do you trust more? Leonidas: [pause] The former’s. Socrates: As do I, Leonidas. A disinterested observer is more reliable than someone who profits by bending the truth. But someone who profits by reaching the truth is more reliable than a disinterested observer. Leonidas: And employers profit by reaching the truth? Socrates: Once they are accused of discrimination, they obviously want to be acquitted, regardless of the facts. But when they make the employment decisions that give rise to cases in the first place, employers do indeed profit by reaching the truth. So why should I prefer the judgment of the jurors who second-guess the employer’s initial decision? Leonidas: You assume that employers always know better. Socrates: I do not. I only assume that employers generally know better. Leonidas: You assume that jurors are never fairer than employers. Socrates: I do not. I only assume that jurors are not generally fairer than employers. Leonidas: So you grant that in certain circumstances, my proposal would function as proposed. Socrates: Absolutely. Nevertheless, your proposal is, on balance, worse than nothing. Leonidas: [taken aback] That hardly seems fair, Socrates. Socrates: Leonidas, you start by painting a grim picture of our “Greek supremacist society.” If you were correct, any sensible Egyptian worker would tell himself, “What’s the point of filing a lawsuit? The jury will be just as unfair as my employer.” Leonidas: I already admitted that I exaggerated. Can’t we move on? Socrates: Relax, I’m recapping. If Greeks are better than you say, a sensible Egyptian workers might indeed want to sue. The question is: Why should an outside observer trust the jury over the employer? Leonidas: And you trust the employer more, because he was the one who had “skin in the game” when he made the initial employment decisions that led to the lawsuit? Socrates: Exactly. Leonidas: You can’t see the fatal flaw in your argument? Socrates: Please help me do so, Leonidas. Leonidas: You only compare the trustworthiness of employers versus jurors. But what about the trustworthiness of the Egyptian workers? They, too, have “skin in the game.” Socrates: [speechless] Leonidas: Ha, got you, Socrates! Socrates: [confused] In a sense, you’re right… Leonidas: [gloating] Just concede, “You’re right, I’m wrong” so we can go home. Socrates: [regains composure] A worker does indeed have a strong financial incentive to get hired. But this incentive is just as strong for an incompetent worker as for a competent one. Leonidas: [squints while listening intently] Socrates: [thinking aloud] In fact, an incompetent worker probably has a stronger incentive to get any particular job, because his other employment options are likely to be worse! Leonidas: So we should trust employers over workers?! Socrates: On the question, “Is this worker profitable to employ?,” absolutely. How could anyone think otherwise? Leonidas: [angry] You’re even worse than a Greek supremacist, Socrates. You’re a full-blown plutocrat! Socrates: Feel free to elaborate next time, Leonidas. We probably won’t get to talk again until after my trial. Leonidas: [semi-sympathetic] Don’t worry, plutocrat. The system works. Socrates: [waves farewell and walks off]";2088
Reflections on the TCU Capitalism versus Socialism Debate;https://betonit.substack.com/p/reflections-on-the-tcu-capitalism;"Two days ago at Texas Christian University, I debated Scott Sehon, chair of Bowdoin College’s Philosophy Department, on Capitalism versus Socialism. (Video forthcoming eventually). My opening statement was a slight variation on the one I wrote for an earlier debate on the same topic with Elizabeth Bruenig. Sehon’s opening statement was adapted from his Socialism: A Logical Introduction, forthcoming next year from Oxford University Press. Here are my main afterthoughts. Prior to the debate, I read a key chapter from Sehon’s book, plus three of his other essays. Two of the pieces (co-authored with his partner Kristen Ghodsee, who I’ve also debated!) defend “anti-anti-Communism.” The third argues that the Nazis were definitely not socialists. The book chapter (not yet available) was quite good. One key thesis is that capitalism and socialism lie on a continuum, which makes perfect sense to me. Sehon proposes a two-dimensional model, where socialism rises positively with (a) the role of government/collective ownership, and (b) the degree of material equality. Sehon doesn’t try to definitionally insist that Marxist-Leninist dictatorships aren’t “real socialism.” Good for him. Instead, like a careful analytic philosopher, he concedes that socialist dictatorships are socialist in some meaningful way. Definitionally, I say it makes a lot more sense to use only Sehon’s part (a) in the definition. Why? Because including (b) begs major questions about the effect of capitalism on material equality. Abolishing specific government interventions plainly can make society more equal. And in the real world, it often would. Deregulating immigration dramatically cuts the size of government and increases (global) equality. So does housing deregulation. Does this mean that these policies are not clear movements in the direction of capitalism? I can’t see why. After dealing with definitional issues, Sehon’s book chapter focuses heavily on the superiority of Scandinavian (relative) socialism to American (relative) capitalism. In the debate, he followed suit. Perhaps since I’d just returned from Auschwitz, I was poised to argue that the Nazis were indeed socialists and that anti-anti-Communism is abominable. Neither of which came up in the debate. Sehon argued that Scandinavian countries are indeed more socialist than the U.S. He’s right, but overstates. On Fraser rankings (0-10), where higher is more capitalist, the U.S. comes out at 8.14 (5th in the world), Denmark at 8.10 (7th), Sweden and Finland 7.81 (tied with Czechia for 17th), and Norway at 7.67 (29th). All four are in the global top quartile. Spain, France, and Italy all come out as more socialist than any Scandinivian economy. Sehon could reply that his measures are better, but one of the virtues of the Fraser scores is that they aggregate many plausible indicators of capitalism versus socialism. Sehon went on to argue that Scandinavian (relative) socialism is better for human well-being than American (relative) capitalism. Some of his measures looked highly suspect to me (though at least he didn’t invoke the execrable Human Development Index!). I do, however, take international happiness data seriously. And yes, on international happiness scores, Scandinavia beats the U.S. But not by much! The latest happiness ranking for the U.S. is #15 out of 149 countries, scoring 6.9 out of 10. Finland is #1, scoring 7.8. Remaining Scandinavian scores: Norway: 7.3, Denmark 7.6, Sweden 7.4. Still, as Sehon points out, the U.S. underperforms on happiness. I didn’t point out, but I should have, that low-population countries normally win top rank on almost any per-capita measure. They also normally “win” bottom rank on almost any per-capita measure. Why? The Law of Large Numbers! Good and bad luck average out more for large populations. So what? For countries with population over 50M, the U.S. is the happiest in the world. That aside, should we think that Scandinavia is happier than the U.S. because of its higher socialism? I think Sehon would agree that it’s a complex question, but one obvious place to start is to look at countries that are culturally very close to the U.S. The top candidates are Canada and the U.K., both moderately more socialist than the U.S. The happiness gap? Negligible: Canada scores .1 happier than the U.S.; the U.K. scores .1 less happy than the U.S. Scott Sehon Sehon mentioned high polarization in the U.S. several times. So I asked him, “If a narrow Democratic majority in the U.S. moved us straight to Scandinavian socialism, would U.S. happiness really rise?” Even he granted that right-wing outrage, soon followed by left-wing counter-outrage, would plausibly swamp the direct happiness boost of socialism itself. The heart of my case was a list of radical free-market reforms that would greatly improve over the observed performance of the U.S. (or almost any First World) economy. Open borders. Radical housing deregulation. Ending universal redistribution. Defunding education. Radical deregulation of nuclear power. Probably the most frustrating part of the debate was that Sehon kept comparing Scandinavia to the U.S., instead of comparing his ideal to my ideal. Sehon did voice sympathy for open borders, but kept doubling back to the merits of Scandinavia socialism. Which, as I explained, is a standard — and puzzling — socialist move. For all their talk of the end of equality, socialists really do seem to fixate on the means of government. It’s a fetish. Although smart leftists will admit that some radical free-market reforms would help the poor and reduce inequality, only government action excites them. Sehon briefly talked about rights-based objections to socialism. He seemed to accept the old-school ACLU rights, but scoffed at any notion of rights to private property or freedom of contract. Which makes little sense. A priest builds a church and holds services. If the government seizes it for the greater good, that violates his rights. Great. A merchant builds a factory and conducts business. If the government seizes it for the greater good, that doesn’t violate his rights? What’s the logic even supposed to be? Both religion and commerce infuse some people’s lives with meaning. For other people, they’re both casual affairs. Why protect all religion — and no commerce — from consequentialist calculations? Sehon seemed to grant many of my points. Yet when he did so, I’m afraid, he was usually misstating my points. When I talked about bad government policies, his rough reply was: “Yes, government isn’t perfect.” But I wasn’t saying that government is less than perfect; I was saying that government — including democratic government — is terrible. Sweden, to use a democracy dear to Sehon’s heart, made the world’s fastest transition to nuclear power from the 60s to the 90s. Then, in response to innumerate public opinion, they threw this historic achievement in the trash and moved swiftly in the opposite direction. Typical! In the debate, I told the audience that the 2020 U.S. presidential election nicely exposes the sheer crumminess of democracy. Trump or Biden: Those are your choices. Sehon replied that choosing between Trump and Biden is better than just letting Elon Musk run the show. A straw man, but I still felt like I could hear the whole audience silently cheering the Elon alternative. P.S. Big thanks to Rob Garnett and Sam Arnold for organizing the event! Great fun.";1252
Ideas for Influencing;https://betonit.substack.com/p/ideas-for-influencing;"Here’s another guest post from the Twitter personality known as SolarxPvP. I bet he’ll be happy to reply to you in the comments! I have thought of several potential routes for making your ideas more influential using your connections. I'd love to see your ideas make a measured impact on the world, and these will likely be your best opportunities in the near future. I hope these things don't seem too idealistic, but I don't think they are and I give reasons to think so. I think they would be great ways to market your ideas and make an impact. 1. Vivek Ramaswamy is a unique politician and presidential candidate (as you seem to have noticed). I don't think I have ever seen a major candidate for president from the two mainstream parties quite as open to ideas and discussion as he (that isn't perhaps Ron Paul). He cares about policy, is curious, and appears open-minded.  His charisma and clarity make him very well-liked, as FiveThirtyEight notes in section 3 here. He had the highest favorability rate of all Republicans who had heard of him (at least at the time). Fascinated by Richard Hanania's critique of his book Woke, Inc., Vivek invited him to appear on his podcast a few months ago. It's cool seeing him write down things that Hanania says and accept his ideas into his repertoire. I have seen him appeal to Hanania's policy solutions to wokeness since then along with Alex Epstein's talking points in his interviews. In his interview with Ron Paul, he says he was a major fan of Paul back in college even though he no longer identifies as a libertarian. However, he still has many confused policies and ideas. He's threatened to invade Mexico to stop drug cartels and I think his education policy is a little confused even if it would be an improvement from the status quo. My friend and CSPI affiliate Jonah Davids explains his confused policy well here. Thanks to your connections with Hanania and Epstein, it's plausible that you could appear on his show and not just moderate him on several issues, but convince him of perspectives he might not have. Have Hanania and Epstein endorse you as a guest, and give him copies of your books. Include pre-release copies of books if you can by then. The top issues you should emphasize: - Housing. Housing regulation has the benefit of being a massive economic issue while also lacking the anti-foreign bias of immigration issues. You should encourage Ramaswamy to place a large emphasis on the effects of housing regulation on popular issues like income inequality, working-class despair, and homelessness. Convince him of the major economic effects of regulation so he'll realize how much it needs to be emphasized.  - Education. Convince him that we will need much more than just school vouchers to change our broken system. - Occupational licensing. This along with the educational system could probably be accurately sloganed and linked together as the ""credential-inflationary complex."" Speaking of, try to think of useful but accurate slogans he could use to appeal to conservatives and the general public for these issues. - Foreign policy. Convince him that even the best forecasters and prediction markets are relatively inaccurate and make most foreign policy reckless. He already supports legalizing some drugs as far as I am aware, so getting him to realize that freeing up the drug market will likely already assuage many of his concerns with Mexico. - Markets. He already wants to abolish much of the state, but try to convince him to go further.  - Immigration. This will be much tougher than the others, but perhaps you could convince him to moderate his position. Little things like open borders with Canada and other first-world countries (with some restrictions on criminals and voting). Perhaps you could convince him that a TSA-like system at the border where people are thoroughly vetted for criminal backgrounds and banned from voting or getting welfare would make the border situation much better. The main hurdle will probably be the ""they're taking our jobs"" issue, however. The best route would be to convince people that we need more low-skilled employees like construction workers and janitors. I know his campaign is still a long shot, but his chances are better than any libertarian. And if he loses, he might still get a spot in the Trump or even Desantis administration. He's been floated as a Trump vice presidential pick. If he were a deciding vote in a Senate deadlock, he could have significant libertarian influence along with taking over the presidency if Trump passes away in office (not unlikely due to his age). He'd also probably have a good influence as a secretary. Then, coming 2028, he could run again with more name recognition.  2. Prospera seems very promising. The recent legal issues against it don't really seem like much of a problem as it's often suggested from what I've read. However, I am skeptical if it's as good as it could be from some of the policies I have seen it implement (it seems to want to elect a council, and its education system might be the typical approach but private). It would be incredible if you could give a speech there engaging and critiquing the way it's doing things while also presenting your other ideas. You have a connection with Niklas Anzinger, and Robin Hanson has visited from what I have seen on Anzinger's blog, so I could totally see it happen. My dream scenario would be for you and some other libertarians in your realm of thinking like Michael Huemer, David Friedman, and Jason Brennan to speak at Prospera in one big event. You guys could all convince the Prospera guys behind it of their own project even more. 3. Libertarian, Austrian economist, and anarcho-capitalist (!) Javier Millei is the betting favorite to win the Argentinian election. His victory would be without a doubt the best political result for libertarians in world history. If this isn't, let me know of something else. I know he's an Austrian and is already a libertarian, but perhaps you could at least chat with him. Make sure he's aiming for an incremental approach that allows for a gradual dissolution of the government and not a radical overnight abolition of the government (if he's allowed to do that). Perhaps you could find some way to have influence on how he does this. Thank you for reading. Sorry for the length, but I believe it was necessary. I hope you find these ideas to be good.";1131
How to Make *Defending the Undefendable* Defensible;https://betonit.substack.com/p/how-to-make-defending-the-undefendable;"When the truth is ugly, people lie. Psychologists call this “Social Desirability Bias.” Human beings exaggerate their patriotism and piety, their altruism and loyalty, their intelligence and their tolerance. Social Desirability Bias (SDB) is embedded in language itself: When someone asks, “Would you like to come to my party?,” you refuse with “Sorry, I can’t” even though that is almost never literally true. Sometimes these lies become so ubiquitous that we lose awareness of our own dishonesty. Until a brave soul like Walter Block loudly challenges our collective mendacity. In 1976, Walter Block published his most controversial work, Defending the Undefendable. Subtitled The Pimp, Prostitute, Scab, Slumlord, Libeler, Moneylender, and Other Scapegoats in the Rogue’s Gallery of American Society, the book famously divided the libertarian world when it was first released. The Mises Bookstore charmingly provides a long inventory of positive and negative reviews. Hayek, Rothbard, Hazlitt, Nozick, and Szasz all praised it; Nathaniel Branden, Sharon Presley, Laissez-Faire Books, and Walter Grinder all panned it. The latter bluntly called Defending the Undefendable, “An absolutely mad way of introducing someone to libertarianism.” The most memorable assessment, however, was Roger MacBride’s: “It is a magnificent book, a trailblazer. I would call it ‘Drano for Clogged Minds,’ except that Drano is neither amusing nor stimulating, and this book is both.” Block’s Defending the Undefendable is remarkable precisely because it turns SDB on its head. Instead of telling readers what they want to hear, Block tells readers — even staunchly libertarian readers — the opposite. He explicitly names counterfeiters, misers, heirs, slumlords, and even “male chauvinist pigs” as “heroes.” And he urges readers to rethink their condemnations of pimps, prostitutes, drug pushers, and addicts. The opening of his chapter on “The Drug Addict” remarks: At the present time, with the intense discussion on the evils of heroin addiction, it is well to heed the old adage - “listen to both sides of the story.” Among the many reasons for this, and perhaps most importantly, is the fact that if everyone is against something (particularly heroin addiction), one can assume that there is something which can be said in its favor. Throughout mankind’s long and disputatious history, the majority opinion has, the majority of times, been wrong.(p.33) As a vocal enemy of Social Desirability Bias, I am naturally sympathetic to Block’s project. And on inspection, many of Block’s notorious arguments in Defending the Undefendable turn out to be correct. Truly, you don’t help the poor by banning low-cost housing and low-skilled jobs. His defenses of moneylenders, “slumlords,” “ghetto merchants,” speculators, importers, middlemen, profiteers, employers, “scabs,” and “rate busters” are compelling applications of microeconomic logic. Block’s chapter on “The Gypsy Cab Driver” verges on visionary: “A proper solution to the taxicab crisis is not to co-opt the movement of gypsy cab drivers by the offer to take them into the system, but rather to destroy the system of restrictive cab licenses.” Decades later, Uber and other ride-sharing services defeated traditional tax licensing with Blockian heroism by openly breaking the law. Unfortunately, other notorious arguments in Block’s classic work turn out to be incorrect, or at least overstated. The lesson of Social Desirability Bias is to disregard ugliness when we assess truth, not to embrace the antinomian view that ugliness is a sign of truth — or that the truth is whatever position is maximally ugly. Reading Defending the Undefendable, it is hard to avoid the conclusion that Block occasionally gets carried away by contrarian joy. Unlike most of Block’s critics, however, my goal is not to refute his work, but to fix it: to make Defending the Undefendable defensible. After identifying flaws, I propose mostly moderate revisions to get the project back on the track of truth. Error #1: Ignoring human irrationality. Throughout his book, Block consistently ignores the possibility that human beings systematically misunderstand their own interests. He is right, of course, that… After considering the good features (short hours, high remuneration), with the drawbacks (harassment by the police, enforced commissions to her pimp, uninspiring working conditions), the prostitute obviously prefers her work, otherwise she would not continue it. (p.4) The same goes for drug addicts and misers. They, too, think that the good features of their lifestyle outweigh the drawbacks. Block concedes that these actors might be mistaken: “The prostitute may feel that the money she was paid did not fully compensate her for the services she provided.” (p.4) The key question is: Are the mistakes of the prostitute, addict, and miser systematic — foreseeable via common sense? In his discussion of drug addiction, Block seems to reject this idea on principle: “Since there is no objective criterion for such choices, there is nothing irrational or even suspect about any choice on the spectrum.” (p.35) But this is awfully dogmatic. Suppose Block was advising a young person that he cared about. If the advisee said, “I’m considering prostitution,” “I’m considering drug addiction,” or “I’m considering becoming a miser,” would Block agnostically reply, “As long as the good features outweigh the drawbacks, go right ahead”? Unlikely. Instead, he would more helpfully respond, “That’s a bad idea, because the drawbacks almost always outweigh the good features.” Or at least he should. Block often appeals to the ugly truth of continuity. He correctly observes that prostitutes are hardly the only people who factor money into their sexual choices: “Many dating patterns clearly conform to the prostitutional model. The male is expected to pay for the movies, dinners, flowers, etc., and the female is expected to reciprocate with sexual services.” (p.6) This hardly implies, however, that prostitutes are choosing just as rationally as anyone else. One can consistently advise against prostitution and advise in favor of considering a romantic partner’s career prospects. Why? Because some ranges of “the spectrum” are prudent and others aren’t. We don’t need perfect precision to acknowledge this truism. How much of Block’s position can we salvage after conceding the reality of human irrationality? Quite a lot. To start, Block could credibly argue that while prostitutes, drug addicts, and misers systematically overrate the net benefits of their choices, the rest of us systematically underrate the frequency of exceptions to this rule. Some prostitutes are very highly-paid relative to their next-best career options; some prostitutes have unusual personalities that allow them to enjoy — or at least not badly mind — their work. Not only are some addicts high-functioning; some plausibly function better with their drug of choice than without. Some misers, similarly, get little joy from material consumption, but have expensive long-run entrepreneurial or philanthropic goals that fill their lives with meaning. Another line of argument consistent with Block’s outlook is the arbitrariness of the list of acceptable paternalisms. Many forms of severe irrationality pass almost unnoticed. Almost no one wants to do much about adults’ poor romantic choices — even when two mismatched twenty-somethings legally promise to stay together until “death do they part.” The same goes for religion. No more than one religion can be true, and people’s lives and potentially afterlives hang in the balance. Yet again, the default position is that even the least mature adults should be allowed to theologically make up their own mind and make their own mistakes. Why do we view prostitution and drug addiction any differently? Finally, a thorough review of Table of Contents of Defending the Undefendable reveals several cases where, contrary to popular prejudice, irrationality is the exception rather than the rule. If a rich man lived and shopped in a “slum,” we might question his rationality, but for a poor person, these choices make sense. The same goes for child labor. Yes, we can easily imagine a minor making horrible job choices. Normally, however, as I explain in my The Case Against Education, a job is a fine way for youths to earn money and acquire valuable human capital at the same time. Error #2: Ignoring (almost all) externalities. The initiation of physical force against person and property is a classic negative externality that Block is ever-ready to condemn (though not in those words). He is also happy to point out any negative side effects of the initiation of force, especially if the government is the initiator: It cannot be stressed strongly enough that these crimes are due to the prohibition of heroin and not the result of heroin addiction. It is the prohibition that drastically forces its price up and drives the addict into a life of crime and brutishness which may end in his own death or that of the victim. (p.29) But Block studiously ignores all other negative externalities produced by the “scapegoats” that he champions. Without regulation, yes, prostitutes, pimps, drug addicts, and drug pushers would mostly do their business out of the public eye. But they would still break up marriages and leave children in broken homes. Without public property, yes, we wouldn’t worry about littering. But public property covered in trash is still much less pleasant than public property not so covered. And libel and slander can spread at least as easily on private property as public property. Block tries to deflect these criticisms with further appeals to continuity: Another argument leveled against addiction is that it prevents people from fulfilling their responsibilities. The example usually given is that of a father who, under the continuous influence of heroin, becomes incapable of fulfilling his financial and other obligations to his family. Let us assume that heroin addiction incapacitates the father. It still does not follow that the use and sale of heroin should be prohibited. It would be unreasonable to prohibit any activity on the grounds that it prevents some people from functioning in certain ways. Why should the people who are not impaired or who do not have like responsibilities be restricted? Were it proper to prohibit heroin for this reason, surely it would also be proper to prohibit gambling, drinking, smoking, automobile driving, air travel, and other dangerous or potentially dangerous activities. But this would be patently absurd. Should heroin be legal for some people but not for the others who do not accept or fulfill their responsibilities because of their addiction? No. When a man, to continue the example, marries, he does not agree to renounce all activities which might be dangerous. The marriage contract is not, after all, a slave contract. Marriage does not prevent either party from engaging in activities which might discomfort the other. People with responsibilities do get heart attacks from playing tennis. But no one would suggest that people with responsibilities be barred from sports activities. (p.35) The common-sense response, again, is that size matters. Suppose Walter Block was offering marriage counseling to a young person he cared about. If the advisee confessed, “She’s furious that I spend $10 a week on chewing gum,” Block would probably respond, “Nobody’s perfect. If that’s her top complaint, she should count herself lucky.” In contrast, if the complaint said, “She’s furious that I spend 90% of our money on heroin,” Block would probably respond, “That’s a terrible way to treat your spouse. You need to stop at once and make amends.” How much of Block’s position can we salvage after conceding the reality of externalities? Again, quite a lot. To start, we must remind ourselves that the negative externalities of these disfavored activities are usually small or non-existent. To use my slogan, “Abusers give vice a bad name.” Severe drug addicts are highly visible in some urban areas, but most users consume in moderation. Prostitutes can break up marriages, but many of their customers are single, or in relationships with partners who do not strongly object. Most libel and slander gets ignored and persuades no one. The argument from arbitrariness is relevant as well. Alcoholism plausibly destroys more families than drug addiction. Infidelity with non-prostitutes plausibly destroys more families than infidelity with prostitutes. But the law and public opinion largely overlook the former and harshly punish the latter. Indeed, once we take externalities seriously, we can actually improve some of Block’s arguments. Yes, blackmailers create negative externalities for their targets. But they also create positive externalities for the rest of society by deterring blackmailable behavior! Legalizing blackmail would plainly discourage adultery, child abuse, embezzling, and much more. Furthermore, while spreading insulting falsehoods is a plausible negative externality, spreading insulting truths is a plausible positive externality. If Jones is a lazy worker, employers ought to know, right? Yet the threat of libel and slander lawsuits almost certainly discourages the spreading of all insults regardless of their truth. Error #3: Exaggerating “heroism.” Murray Rothbard’s introduction to Defending the Undefendable warns that Blocks’ scapegoats are “Heroes yes, but not necessarily saints.” (p.xi) But even calling them all “heroes” abuses the English language. True, Block’s proposed criteria sound reasonable: [T]hree criteria for heroic actions must be applied. The act must not violate the rights of innocent people; the act must be of great benefit to large numbers of people; and it must be performed at great personal risk. (p.109) Indeed, Block’s appeal to ""great benefit to large numbers of people” comes close to endorsing the notion of “positive externalities.” He just needs one caveat: He should have specified a “great net benefit” to rule out actions that help many people but harm even more. That aside, Block neglects another crucial feature of heroism: motive. In ordinary language, an action isn’t heroic if its sole motive was amoral. In any case, even if we accept Block’s criteria, his “heroes” often fail to qualify. Take the drug addict. Drug addiction per se does not violate the rights of innocents, and does entail considerable risks. How, though, is addiction “of great benefit to large numbers of people”? For littering, Block has a case if the litterer loudly announces that he is littering in order to protest the injustice of public property. But this virtually never happens. Actual littering fails on two of his three criteria. Normally, the litterer is virtually the sole beneficiary of his action — and the personal risk is slight. How can we amend Block’s position? The first step is to tone down the praise. Instead of calling his scapegoats “heroes,” just say that their actions are “potentially heroic.” While the typical prostitute is no hero, sex worker/Substacker Aella arguably qualifies because she really does publicly stand up for her rationalist moral principles. The second step is to dwell less on the questionable virtue of the scapegoats and more on the glaring vice of the scapegoaters. At minimum, the scapegoaters are morally negligent. Drug warriors, for example, rarely even try to explain why their crusade is any better than alcohol prohibition. Most of the time, moreover, the scapegoaters are worse than morally negligent. Middlemen, “profiteers,” and many of the other occupations they attack actually turn out to be vital for human well-being. Walter Block is a tenacious debater, and his commitment to Misesian economics is legendary. I would be amazed if this short essay changed his mind about anything. My chief goal, however, is to persuade critical friends and friendly critics that Block’s infamous praxeological book deserves a psychological reformulation. Though he never mentions Social Desirability Bias by name, Defending the Undefendable is a brave defense of “ugly truths” over “pretty lies.” Why not focus on that, instead of continuing to insist that human behavior is always rational and that externalities are a myth? Postscript An economist in my department once described Walter Block as “the biggest jackass in all of economics,” but my earliest memory of Walter is indelibly positive. We met at the 1989 Ludwig von Mises summer seminar at Stanford University when I was straight out of high school. After introducing myself to “Professor Block” on the way to class, he affably responded, “Just call me Walter.” I enjoyed the whole week arguing with this first-name-basis professor. While in college, I actually sent him letters (not emails) — and Walter graciously mailed back in-depth replies. Once I became a professor, Walter replied to my critique of his cherished Misesian brand of economics. Then I replied, then he replied, then I replied, then he replied again. I let him have the last word, so according to Block’s “Whoever published the last word in a debate, won the debate” standard, he was victorious. A Festschrift often accompanies a scholar’s retirement, but I for one hope that Walter stays the course. Remember, old friend: Never retiring is the best revenge.";2793
A Homeschool Retrospective;https://betonit.substack.com/p/a-homeschool-retrospective;I started homeschooling my twins, Aidan and Tristan, in 2015, when they entered 7th grade. We recorded this podcast in the summer of 2017 as part of their middle school graduation. At the time, we thought they’d be switching over normal high school. Fortunately, that lasted only three weeks. All paternal pride aside, my sons were already wise beyond their years. Anything good you do for them, you do for me. And I predict you’ll be glad you did! To hear the twins four years later, the three of us were part of this Freakonomics “Economist’s Guide to Parenting” podcast: P.S. You hear me (sans twins) on the same topic on the original 2011 Freakonomics episode.;120
*The Myth of Left and Right*: The Last Word of Hyrum Lewis;https://betonit.substack.com/p/the-myth-of-left-and-right-the-last;"Here’s Hyrum Lewis’ reaction to my response to his response to our interview. Thank you, Bryan, for this opportunity to discuss our book. I must confess, though, that for as much as I’ve enjoyed our conversation—what could be more fun than talking ideas with great intellects like Bryan Caplan, Robin Hanson, and Verlan Lewis?—I’ve found it largely unproductive thus far because we’ve been talking past each other. I take responsibility for this because I made two terminological errors that have caused confusion about what we are and are not claiming. First error: “essentialist” First, I made the mistake of calling the theory we oppose, “essentialist.” This led us into all kinds of interesting but ultimately irrelevant tangents about whether categories like Christian, libertarian, male, female, or Mormon have philosophical essences or whether something like “Utah” is an adequate social scientific idealization. I should have instead called the incorrect theory “monist” to indicate that our thesis is simply this: There is more than one issue in politics. That’s all. It’s not complicated nor should it even be controversial. It is common sense, just as it’s common sense that there is more than one species in biology, more than one illness in medicine, more than one element in chemistry, etc. Second error: “social” Second, I made the even worse mistake of calling our theory the “social theory” instead of the “pluralist theory.” This led people to think we were claiming that “Conservatives and liberals are 100% tribal and 0% principled” or, as one commenter put it, “Everyone is tribal except for those who aren’t”—an obvious tautology. We don’t believe this and if we ever said it, we were in error. OK, so if we aren’t saying that ideologues are 100% tribal, what are we saying? Simply that social conformism explains the bundling of distinct issue positions. This is in contrast to the monist position which says that an underlying “one big issue” explains the bundling (“correlation” is the term we used in the book). In other words, we are not saying that ideologues are 100% tribal, we are saying that ideologies are 100% tribal. Let me unpack this a bit more because it’s a subtle but crucial distinction that gets to the heart of our misunderstanding: The monist theory persists largely because it explains the puzzling fact that seemingly unrelated issue positions tend to correlate. It does so by positing an underlying “one big issue,” such as “change.” E.g., if conservatives are more likely than the average person to favor tax cuts and oppose abortion, then there must be an underlying anti-change disposition (conservatism) causing them to hold both positions. The connection between those distinct issues is what requires explanation and the monist theory explains it by invoking “one big issue” such as “change.” Our position, by contrast, is that this correlation can better be explained by social conformism. Pro-life and anti-tax views tend to go together because people who are pro-life are more likely to join the right-wing tribe and then adopt its tax policy as a matter of socialization. So our position on socialization is simply that tribal conformity is sufficient to explain the correlation between these distinct issues. We are not saying that ideologues are 100% tribal or that “nobody has any principles.” When we say, “100% tribal,” we are only talking about the bundling, not the people. Let me illustrate the difference: if Mary is an uncompromising pro-life activist who believes for principled reasons that abortion is murder, then on that one issue, Mary is principled. But as a pro-lifer she will likely begin to associate with other pro-lifers, join the Republican party, identify as conservative and then adopt the other issues of that tribe as a matter of socialization—she will be more likely than the average citizen to support tax cuts, for instance. Is Mary 100% tribal then? No. When it comes to abortion, she is totally principled. She will change many of her views for social reasons, but she will never compromise on abortion. But the degree of tribalism we do see in the “Marys” of the world is sufficient to explain why pro-lifers also tend to be anti-tax. The correlation is 100% tribal even though the person, Mary, is not. 85% Agreement Given this misunderstanding, I now see why you kept saying, “I 85% agree with you.” Our thesis (which we apparently didn’t do a good job of stating clearly) is that there is more than one issue in politics, but you can’t 85% agree that there is more than one issue in politics any more than you can 85% agree that there is more than one species in biology or more than one element in chemistry. But now I think I get your point: you were saying that people aren’t entirely motivated by tribal conformity in the positions they hold—it’s more like 85% tribal, 15% principled. And you know what, Bryan? If that’s what you are saying, I actually completely agree with you! Mary is principled about abortion and if abortion constitutes about 15% of the conservative cause today (which sounds about right to me), then Bryan Caplan hit the nail on the head in saying that that Mary (and most other self-identified “conservatives” or “liberals/progressives”) are 15% principled and 85% tribal. Mary will switch on 85% of her issues with social priming, but not on that 15% pro-life issue. And while Mary was principled on abortion, other conservatives will be principled on gun rights, immigration, racial equality, low taxes, or military strength. The joining together of distinct, principled interest groups is how the Republican coalition formed. Our point is that there is no underlying “conservatism” connecting these groups and their principles—that’s the myth of left and right (and the myth serves the interests of the coalition because it creates loyalty among the constituents). These disparate interests and views are connected only socially, not philosophically. So it’s not that there is “one big issue” in politics (with people on the “left” or “right” of that one big issue), but that there are “two big tribes” in politics (with people anchoring into those tribes for principled reasons and then conforming for social reasons). So conservatives aren’t 100% tribal, but conservatism is 100% tribal (if by “conservatism” we mean the connective tissue between conservative issue positions). And it is evidence for this position (and not “ideologues are 100% tribal”) that we provided in our book. To summarize: people think we are saying, “Everyone is 100% tribal”; and it appears you are saying, “Actually, people are only 85% tribal so you guys are taking things too far.” But we aren’t saying people are 100% tribal, we are only saying that the amount of tribal conformism we see (85% sounds about right) is sufficient to explain the clustering of beliefs in the population. OK, Bryan, do we agree at least on this? Once we clear away the bad associations I created with my poor choice of terminology, and instead look at our actual argument, I think that we do. Anti-Market OK, now having cleared that up and established what I think is agreement, I’m going to go even further and say that you agree 100% (not 85%) with the central thesis of our book. It appears to me that you, Bryan Caplan, share our belief that there’s more than one issue in politics. Here’s why: You keep saying that the fundamental issue of the left is “anti market” and the fundamental issue of the right is “anti-left,” and yet that very formulation contains two dimensions (a “pro vs. anti-market” dimension and a “pro vs. anti-left” dimension). Right there you’ve given us more than “one big issue” in politics, haven’t you? Furthermore, I think you would readily concede that being against markets isn’t the only cause of “the left.” In recent years they have championed other issues that have nothing to do with being anti-market, such as abortion rights, more immigration, pacifism, drug legalization, separating church and state, free speech, police reform, vaccination, etc. Right there, you have many more issues than the two you mentioned, right? Ergo, Bryan Caplan is a political pluralist like us (unless you believe that being anti-market is the only issue in politics and all other issues are somehow an expression of one’s position on markets, but everything I’ve read by you suggests you don’t believe that—after all, you yourself are extremely pro-market and extremely pro-immigration). So even if left-wingers have, in general, always been anti-market (a point I don’t concede by the way: left-liberal Thomas Jefferson and his millions of followers were pro market; left-liberal Andrew Jackson and his millions of followers were pro-market; the millions of left-liberal Locofocos were pro-market; the millions of left-liberal Mugwumps were pro-market, etc.), that is irrelevant to the question of whether there is only one issue in politics because markets are not the only issue. And if you really are just using the term “left-wing” as a synonym for “anti-market,” then why not just say “anti-market” instead of “left-wing”? Wouldn’t that more accurately communicate that you are just talking about the one issue of markets and not abortion, race, drug control, etc.? Why not just use the less confusing of the two terms that doesn’t carry all of the monist baggage? Counter-evidence OK, since we have been talking past each other on our thesis, we have also been talking past each other about the evidence for that thesis. For instance, you say, …notice that when intellectuals fail to respond to priming and proclaim their continued loyalty to “true conservatism” or “true liberalism,” you refuse to count this as evidence in favor of essentialism. Why not? Once again, this is based on the misunderstanding that our thesis is, “everyone is 100% tribal” and that’s not true. We are simply saying that there is enough social conformism (demonstrated in these laboratory experiments) to explain the correlation between unrelated positions. So, yes, of course these experiments will show that some people on some issues wouldn’t change their minds for social reasons. Bryan Caplan wouldn’t. Verlan Lewis wouldn’t. Robin Hanson wouldn’t. Hyrum Lewis wouldn’t (I hope), but there are enough people who would to explain why distinct issue positions tend to go together. Again, the astrology analogy is really helpful here. What if those born from July 22-August 23 (Leos) actually are slightly more likely than the public at large to join the military?. This wouldn’t make us conclude that this correlation is caused by star alignment. We would conclude that it’s because Leos are conforming to stereotype. If a Leo believes in astrology, then they will say, “Oh. Since I was born August 1, I must be brave and as a brave man I’ll join the military.” And if we found this correlation only among those few Leos who believed in astrology and actively consulted their horoscope, then that would be overwhelming evidence that the correlation is explained by social reasons, not mystical ones. But drawing this obvious conclusion wouldn’t be the same as saying, “100% of Leos conform to stereotype” because obviously not all of them do. It’s just that enough of them do to explain why Leos are slightly more likely than other Americans to join the military. This degree of conformism among Leos (less than 100%) explains that correlation much better than the far-fetched idea that star alignments cause character traits, and this degree of conformism among conservatives (less than 100%) explains issue-position correlation much better than the far-fetched idea that there is just one issue in politics. Note also that your objection here serves to highlight the reality of political pluralism because it shows that there are many distinct bundles of positions, not just two. The fact that some people who call themselves “conservatives” switch many of their views with priming such that they have one bundle of positions (call it “Bundle A”), and other people calling themselves “conservatives” adhere to the old Reagan policies such that they have a different bundle of positions (call it “Bundle B”), and other people calling themselves “conservatives” adhere to the old Taft policies such that they have a different bundle of positions (call it “Bundle C”) and so on (D, E, F…), underscores the point that there isn’t just one big issue in politics leading to just two bundles (depending on whether you are on the left or right of that one issue), but that there are many issues in politics and many ways to bundle them. Falsification I also think we are talking past each other when it comes to the matter of “falsification” because we are using that term in two different senses. You say, Why is falsificationism an absurd philosophy of science? “One failed prediction falsifies the theory” is the slogan.  If this is what you mean by “falsification,” then, obviously you are right and nobody does or should believe in “falsificationism.” But what I (and, contra popular belief, Karl Popper) mean by “falsification” is: 1) scientific theories must be testable, and 2) if evidence won’t change our minds about a theory, we are not really testing it. After all, we can confirm any theory by telling ex-post stories that incorporate all conceivable evidence. A good scientific theory makes specific predictions: it says, “if this theory is correct, we should see ‘X’ but not ‘Y.’” Testable, scientific theories lay out what contrary evidence would look like; untestable, non-scientific theories say that there is no conceivable contrary evidence because we will find a way to accommodate all evidence through storytelling. This isn’t “one failed prediction falsifies,” it’s just the willingness to change our minds in the face of new evidence (and how much and what kind of evidence is enough to get us to change/falsify will depend on the theory). And also contra popular belief, Bayesian reasoning is not opposed to Popperian falsification, but goes hand-in-hand with it because we can’t update our beliefs if we see everything as confirming them (e.g., a Christian Fundamentalist can’t update the probability of six-day creationism if they see all fossil evidence for evolution as a trick placed there by God to test their faith; an astrologer can’t update the probability that planet alignments cause personality traits when they interpret all Leo actions as “brave”). So my whole point here is that political monism rests on the same approach as astrology and other pseudo-sciences—everything confirms it, nothing falsifies it. The X value is infinite, the Y value is zero. Political monists say that being conservative goes along with militarism, free trade, small government, and balanced budgets…until conservatives turn against these issues at which point the monists make up stories about how being conservative actually goes along with the opposite policies. There is no conceivable falsifying evidence. Like the astrologer or religious fundamentalist, they will make up a story to show how their theory “predicted” everything (monism “predicts” conservatives will support free trade to conserve the American tradition of capitalism and it “predicts” conservatives will support protectionism to conserve American industry and jobs). Since X is infinite, and Y is zero for political monism, it is on the same intellectual plane as astrology. OK, but what about political pluralism? Is it falsifiable? Of course. If we pluralists saw that seemingly unrelated political positions do, in fact, bundle in stable patterns across time, that would be evidence against our theory. If we were to find that those positions bundled in the same pattern across cultures, that would be evidence against our theory. If we were to find that those who were ignorant of the political spectrum were just as likely to hold the “conservative” or “liberal” bundles of positions as those who are steeped in it, that would be evidence against our theory. If we were to find that identical twins raised in different socio-political environments wound up with the same set of issue positions as adults, that would be evidence against our theory. If we saw conservative opinion turn against big-government Republican politicians, that would be evidence against our theory. If we saw liberal opinion favoring anti-market Republicans over more pro-market Democrats, that would be evidence against our theory. And if there was enough of such counter-evidence, we political pluralists would be willing to say, “we were wrong.” We pluralists clearly delineate what evidence would work against our theory, but the monists do not. They simply say, “tell me what conservatives are doing, and I’ll make up a story about how it conserves.” That’s not rational or scientific. Hitler/Private Language OK, now on to something that puzzles me a bit. You say, Leftists will often say [Hitler was right-wing]. Very few self-identified rightists will. Indeed, most rightists who confront this issue normally argue that Hitler was “really” a leftist. Check out this little poll I did. That’s interesting that the people in your poll consider Hitler “on the left,” but they are in the minority. In general public discourse (and in just about every history or government class I’ve ever taken), Hitler is classified as right-wing. ChatGPT is a pretty good indicator of conventional wisdom, and here’s what it just said when I asked it if Hitler was right wing or left wing: “Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party are typically classified as right-wing due to their promotion of extreme nationalist, authoritarian, and anti-communist ideologies.” So aren’t these people calling Hitler “left wing” using a private language? Hitler is typically considered, “right wing,” but you seem to be saying, “This is contested. Many people would place Hitler at the far left” to which I respond, “Exactly!” That’s precisely why political monism is so foolish. When we conceive of politics as having just one dimension, we can cherry pick which issue in politics is “the big one” and then put anyone anywhere on the line accordingly. Consequently, the political spectrum communicates either gibberish or misinformation. So why are we trying to place Hitler on a line when we don’t even know what that line is measuring (“He’s far right!” “No, actually he’s on the left!”)? Why not just say, “Hitler was a nationalist” or “Hitler was an anti-Semite,” or “Hitler was a socialist,” or “Hitler was a militarist”? That would communicate actual information. Placing him on a line communicates nothing at best and misinformation (“He was right wing so he must have been in favor of free markets!”) at worst. And, perhaps I’m misunderstanding you, but previously you were saying that Hitler is on the far right because he was extremely anti-left, but now you seem to be agreeing with those who claim that “Actually, Hitler can be seen as on the far left.” Isn’t this a retreat from your “anti market vs. anti left” framing? If we can’t even agree on what value the spectrum is modeling (anti-left, which makes Hitler “far right,” or anti-market, which makes Hitler “far left”) then we really should just give up this magic line as our guiding model—it communicates nonsense. I think the same point holds when you say, More thoughtful leftists repeatedly acknowledge that Trump isn’t clearly right-wing. Back in 2015, Ezra Klein called him “the perfect moderate.” In 2020, New York Magazine ran a story called “Trump Isn’t a Moderate, But He Plays One on TV.” But, in your conceptualization, doesn’t “right wing” mean anti-left? And isn’t Trump unquestionably anti-left? So why are you now saying he’s “moderate”? You say that left-right is useful because it communicates an underlying reality (anti-market vs. anti-left), but now it appears you are saying that it doesn’t communicate that underlying reality because left-right mean different things to different people in different contexts, which is exactly what we have been saying all along. Ezra Klein says Trump is a “moderate” for opposing cuts to entitlement programs, but other people say Trump is an “extremist” for being so anti-immigrant. We are back to the point we keep making over and over: these are distinct issues. So instead of pretending that immigration and size of government are the same issue and modeling both on a single line, we should accede to the reality that they are distinct and discuss them separately. That’s really not too hard. Being specific and granular is what we do in every other complex realm of life. Other Spectra This leads us to the next point. I said, “We don’t use a unidimensional spectrum in any other complex realm of life for good reason” to which you responded: Actually, we use many such spectra. Masculine versus feminine. Smart versus stupid. Rich versus poor. None are perfect. Almost all are useful. But wait a minute. Notice that I said we don’t use a spectrum in any other complex realm of life. We can and should use spectra in simple realms because unidimensional models are useful if the underlying reality is unidimensional (as it is with rich vs. poor). When we are dealing with one dimension such as “hot vs. cold,” then a one-dimensional spectrum is useful. But a unidimensional model, by definition, is not adequate to represent a multidimensional reality. For instance, what if I said that we can model biology using a single spectrum, with male, tailed, vertebrates on the left, and female, untailed, invertebrates on the right? You would say that this is absurd because those three traits are distinct, that there are many dimensions to biology, and that such a complex realm can’t be modeled on a single spectrum. We don’t say “That’s a left-wing animal”; we just say, “That animal is female” and leave out unrelated biological traits such as tail presence and skeletal structure. That’s exactly my point about politics. It’s a complex realm with many dimensions like biology, not a simple realm with one dimension like temperature, so it’s not useful to model it using a spectrum. Politics, like biology, is pluralist not monist and we should do in politics what we have done in biology: keep unrelated issues unbundled. Of course our party system is binary so we should talk about Democrats and Republicans, but underlying political dispositions are not binary, so we should stop conceptualizing politics in terms of “left vs. right.” The reality of binary parties has led to the delusion of binary political types so let’s keep the reality and shed the delusion. Utility OK, going further on the question of “usefulness,” you say, When researchers claim that the spectrum is useful, what they mean rather is that using the spectrum helps us to understand political identity and political conflict. Which it totally does…. I use the spectrum because it helps me understand the political world as it really is  OK, once again we are talking past each. I’m saying the political spectrum is “not useful” because it’s based on a delusion, but you are saying that it helps us understand the way people self-identify and explain their actions. I agree and we make exactly this point in the book: a spectrum can give us information about tribal affinities because Americans, unfortunately, have bought into the delusion that there is just one issue in politics and have organized their identities and conflicts accordingly. That’s why we called our theory the “social theory of ideology”—there isn’t “one big issue” in politics, but there are certainly many people who have created identity categories around the delusion that there is. The delusion itself is not useful, but understanding the identity categories based on the delusion can be. In that sense, I’m saying that the political spectrum is not useful in the same way that astrology is not useful: it’s based on a delusion. But could scholars profitably use astrological categories to understand people who do believe in astrology? Sure. If Leos formed a “National Leo Alliance,” and rioted against Capricorns in New York City, scholars would want to talk about the “Leo” identity category and the conflict it motivated, even though the category itself was based on a delusion. But, contra what you say, that’s generally not how scholars use the political spectrum. The research is clear that social-science academics tend to identify with ideological categories at a much higher rate than the public at large (almost all of them self-identify as “left”). It’s as if those studying astrology suddenly turned to full-time horoscope writing and training professional astrologers. That’s why I say we should retire the political spectrum. As long as we use it (even if we understand that it is only useful to understand identity and conflict), we are reinscribing the delusion. So why not, as we say in the book, puncture the delusion by using accurate terms such as Republican and Democrat to describe political actors? It’s hard to say “the left” or “the right” without conjuring up images of a magical line that models the non-existent “one big issue.” George W. Bush anti-market OK, on to your claim that “it’s not clear that George W. Bush was anti-market.” My assertion that he was the most anti-market president in a generation was based on data I got from the Cato Institute’s “Economic Freedom of the World” report: https://www.cato.org/blog/global-economic-freedom-slightly-united-states-still-low According to this study, economic freedom fell more under Bush than any other president in a generation. For charts and commentary, see: https://danieljmitchell.wordpress.com/2014/10/10/the-united-states-improves-to-12-in-new-rankings-of-global-economic-freedom/ And https://savvyroo.com/chart-440723381309-the-continuing-u-s-decline-in-economic-freedom I’ll be interested to look more closely at the Fraser data you provided to see if it will change my mind, but Cato’s seems more convincing simply because it aligns with what we know about Bush’s record on big government. Size of government is one of the most important components of economic freedom and government spending as a percentage of GDP increased radically under Bush (yes, more than any president in a generation). This supports the Cato study, but contradicts Fraser so I must confess that Fraser looks a bit suspect from the get go. If Cato is right that economic freedom went way down under FDR and way down under Bush, why does the Left love FDR and hate Bush when their policies moved the country in the same anti-market direction? Because there are more issues in politics beyond just “anti-market vs. pro-market.” False Impression I said, “Why give people the false impression that you are a racist, anti-immigrant warmonger because you believe in free markets?” You said:   Do I give this impression? Sadly, yes. Have you read Nancy Maclean? Her contention is that free-market George Mason University economists are continuing the racist, white supremacist project of John C. Calhoun. Her evidence? Both free markets and racism are “radical right.” And, no, she’s not just one marginal crank: hers is the standard view accepted by the historical profession. Her book has received awards and nearly unanimous praise from academic historians (see the “Democracy in Chains” Wikipedia page). So, yes, the political spectrum is making thousands of really influential people (history professors at the best universities in the country and their students) believe that you are engaged in a “racist” project simply because you believe in free markets and, per the political spectrum, free markets and racism are connected by an some underlying, evil “one big issue.” Nancy Maclean’s failure to understand that there is more than one issue in politics (markets are one, racism is a different one) is causing all kinds of harm, especially the hatred and antipathy it generates towards good (non-racist) people like you, Tyler Cowen, James Buchanan, Robin Hanson and the rest. Monism strikes again. Finally, you conclude by saying, What I won’t do is throw away a useful tool because I wish I lived in world where the tool didn’t work. Again, is astrology “useful”? Only inasmuch as it tells us about people’s delusions and identities and conflicts based on those delusions. Sadly, most people (including scholars) use the political spectrum not to understand identities, but to model an imaginary “one big issue” and there is nothing useful about that.";4871

On Firing Into a Crowd and Accidentally Hitting Hitler;https://betonit.substack.com/p/on-firing-into-a-crowd-and-accidentally;I’ve been using the following hypothetical for a long time. It doesn’t google, so I’m pretty sure that I originated it. The year is 1946. You’re in Buenos Aires and see an ordinary crowd of people. Due to severe misanthropy, you take out a gun and shoot randomly in their general direction. You hit exactly one person and he dies. Yet as luck would have it, the person you killed turns out to be none other than Adolf Hitler. The next day, global headlines trumpet, “Hitler Shot Dead in Argentina.” What are questions raised by this moral thought experiment? What are its lessons? My top five: Was this a virtuous act? I say the answer is obviously No. You tried to kill people you reasonably believed were innocent. Plus, your motive was awful. While you made the world a better place, you were trying to do the opposite. Did you make the world a better place in deontological terms? Yes, because you killed a person who richly deserved to die for his crimes. Did you make the world a better place in consequentialist terms? Yes again. Due to the media coverage, you helped deter murderous ideologues around the world. Who, after all, would imagine that you hit Hitler accidentally? Even if you revealed the truth in a tell-all interview, no one would believe you: “You had no idea that the man you were shooting was Hitler. Right, like I’m really going to believe that.” Did you do the right thing? Using standard usage in analytic philosophy, yes. An exemplary moral advisor with full information presumably would have told you to shoot Hitler. (If you protest, “You should have just informed local authorities,” I’ll just tweak the hypothetical to stipulate that local authorities are corrupt or incompetent). And you did precisely that. Needless to say, randomly shooting crowds remains horribly wrong! The fact that a seemingly wrong action has a miniscule probability of being right is, as laymen say, academic. Stepping back, when is my hypothetical even relevant? Simple: Anytime someone defends a vicious action that — against all odds — works out well. Feeling dumbfounded? Just respond, “That’s like firing into a crowd and accidentally hitting Hitler” - and listeners will either grasp your point at once, or be intrigued enough to request elaboration.;389

Semi-Intellectual: The Sequel;https://betonit.substack.com/p/semi-intellectual-the-sequel;After Robin and I interviewed the Lewis brothers, they both wrote detailed replies. Here’s my reply to Verlan Lewis’ reply. He’s in blockquotes, I’m not. We do believe people are capable of thinking about politics philosophically. As you say in the interview, some people come to their issue positions based on belief systems like Aristotelianism, Christianity, and libertarianism. Our argument is simply that these various belief systems have nothing to do with “left” or “right.” The terms “left” and “right” have become so entwined with alternating party control of various governments over the centuries that the terms have become meaningless from a philosophical standpoint. They give us social, but not ideological, information. Verlan, suppose you wanted to defend a purely social theory of Aristotelianism, Christianity, or libertarianism. I think you could do so convincingly using arguments that match those you use in The Myth of Left and Right. Why? Because all notable philosophical and religious movements have a large social component. Since you don’t hold a purely social view of Aristotelianism, Christianity, or libertarianism, however, you would presumably respond, “Despite their large social components, they have some intellectual components, too.” That’s precisely my position on the left-right spectrum. If you’d only reply “Left and right are less intellectual than Aristotelianism, Christianity, and libertarianism,” we’d agree. Instead, you insist that left and right are “meaningless from a philosophical standpoint.” Which is hyperbole. Another common misperception is that we do not believe that any issue positions have any logical connection to each other. This is also not our view. We do believe that issue positions can have a logical connection. There are some issue positions that do naturally correlate by virtue of nature and logic. For example, being in favor of free markets domestically is logically connected to being in favor of free trade internationally. It makes sense, on that micro level, that those positions would go together. When you assess the intellectual coherence of left and right, you use a high bar. Hyrum explicitly defends this high bar. “Makes sense,” in contrast, is a low bar. Economists of the Dani Rodrik persuasion will say things along the lines of: “I favor free trade domestically but not internationally because a national government is only good at correcting market failures when all involved parties are under its jurisdiction.” Do I agree? No. But does Rodrik’s position at least “make sense”? Sure. Plenty of arguments about what’s “really” left or right are above the same low bar. However, that has nothing to do with “left” and “right” because those are tribes rather than philosophies: the issue positions and values of those two tribes are constantly evolving. Evolving at what rate? As I told Hyrum, if ideologies change by 1% per century, that is a big mark in favor of essentialism. If ideologies change by 1% per day, that is a big mark against. But we’re somewhere between those extremes, so why adopt your extreme position? A great question you raised in our interview (paraphrasing) was: “Isn’t the stark dichotomy you present between the essentialist theory and the social theory as false as the stark left-right dichotomy you criticize in the book”? In other words, why does it have to be all or nothing? Can’t the social theory usefully explain, for example, 85% of the political behavior we observe and the essentialist theory usefully explain a mere 15% of the political behavior we observe? Glad you agree it’s a “great question”! I don’t think the essentialist theory of left and right explains 15% of the political phenomena we observe in the world for the same reason that I do not think the geocentric theory of the universe explains 15% of the astronomical phenomena we observe. Yes, the geocentric theory can purport to give an explanation of the phenomena we observe each day (including why the sun rises in the east horizon and sets in the west horizon), but that does not make the geocentric theory 15% true. It is 100% false. The fact is that the earth revolves around the sun and the fact is that there is more than one issue in politics. It is not 15% true that the sun revolves around the earth or 15% true that there is only one, overarching, essential issue in politics. This begs the question. The heliocentric theory accounts for all the facts that the geocentric theory does, plus many more facts contradicted by the geocentric theory. Your social theory outperforms the pure essentialist theory, but underperforms a mixed theory. Seriously, if you’ll buy a mixed social/essentialist theory of Aristotelianism, Christianity, and libertarianism, how can you so categorically reject a mixed theory of left and right? Many people assume that if the survey data shows x amount of correlation between these issue positions (above no correlation at all), then the essentialist theory must be x% true. We disagree that this x amount of correlation has to be the result of an essence that ties issue positions together. You are correct to do so. “Has to be” is a strong claim. We point out that this correlation appears to be entirely the result of socialization (after all, the correlation does not exist among those who do not know what currently flies under the banners of “left” and “right”). You are incorrect to do so. “Entirely the result of socialization” is also a strong claim! And your parenthetical evidence is weak. Suppose someone says, “Arithmetic is real because knowledge of addition and multiplication correlate.” A critic replies, “Not for 1st-graders, so it’s all socialization.” Do you find that reply convincing? I hope not. Your time-traveling conventions thought experiment goes from the realm of current correlations to historical correlations. I liked that because it helped us think through the correlation vs. causation difficulty even more. You say that if we gathered into two camps everyone who has ever identified as “left-wing,” and put them in a convention, and everyone who has ever identified as “right-wing,” and put them in a convention, then we would see a lot of diversity within each convention but, on the margins, some views that are more common to the “left-wing” convention than the “right-wing” convention. You conclude that this must be the result of an essence binding together these core issue positions. To a modest degree! For example, you posited that Tribe Left is defined by an “anti-market” essence and pointed to the supposed agreement we would find in the time-traveling “left-wing” convention around the position of being anti-market. I pointed out that Team Left was first created in Paris in the 1780s by people who were opposed to monarchy and who were pro-market. You responded that it took a few years, but eventually, the French sorted themselves out and the people who were anti-monarchy finally came around to their natural position of being anti-market. Actually, I’d go further. I see little sign that Team Left in the 1780s was pro-market. The Declaration of the Rights of Man is already deeply statist. Once again, I found the discussion thought-provoking and interesting, and I hope to keep the conversation going. Likewise, Verlan. As I keep saying, our views are very close. But you and your brother are taking a good idea too far. Just tone it down marginally and you will be exactly correct.;1253
Reflections on the Brook-Caplan Anarcho-Capitalism Debate;https://betonit.substack.com/p/reflections-on-the-brook-caplan-anarcho;"Thanks to everyone who attended Monday’s debate, and a special thanks to Gene Epstein for running the Soho Forum. By the power of Gene, I’ve done a total of four Soho debates: the robot domination debate with Robin Hanson, the defund college debate with Ed Glaeser, the Covid immigration debate with Mark Krikorian, and now the anarcho-capitalism debate with Yaron Brook. While the debate format gave me ample time for rebuttal, I still have much to get off my chest. If Yaron Brook is any indication, the Ayn Rand Institute improved a lot since 1989, when I spent two full weeks at the ARI-affiliated Jefferson School. Back then, ARI would purge you even for talking to libertarians about anything. Now its chairman publicly debates me on anarcho-capitalism. And he was an affable fellow in the green room. I struggle to reconstruct the philosophical rationale for this revisionism - but I’m glad it happened. To be blunt, Brook had little to add to Rand’s straw man attack on anarcho-capitalism in “The Nature of Government.” Yes, it is possible for free-market defense agencies to fight. But it is routine for governments to fight. Yes, it is possible for free-market legal codes to allow what should be forbidden, and forbid what should be allowed. But it is routine for governments to allow what should be forbidden, and forbid what should be allowed. Rand and Brook commit the classic statist error of advocating an idealized government, then mistaking a pile of tautologies for arguments. Here’s Rand: If physical force is to be barred from social relationships, men need an institution charged with the task of protecting their rights under an objective code of rules. This is the task of a government — of a proper government — its basic task, its only moral justification and the reason why men do need a government. A government is the means of placing the retaliatory use of physical force under objective control—i.e., under objectively defined laws. Logically, this is as lame as me saying: If physical force is to be barred from social relationships, men need an industry charged with the task of protecting their rights under an objective code of rules. This is the task of a protection industry — of a proper protection industry — its basic task, its only moral justification and the reason why men do need a protection industry. A protection industry is the means of placing the retaliatory use of physical force under objective control—i.e., under objectively defined laws. What’s the alternative to tautological trickery? One approach is the study of history. Unfortunately, history reveals no strong examples of either minarchy or anarcho-capitalism. The United States wasn’t exactly minarchy even in 1880, and Iceland wasn’t exactly anarcho-capitalism even in the year 1000. Still, these are probably history’s closest approximations to minarchy and anarcho-capitalism, and we can learn a lot by studying them. Long story short: Both worked well for their era, but Iceland decayed into statism more slowly. (For the state-of-the-art on Iceland, see this recent paper by my colleagues Vincent Geloso and Peter Leeson). Furthermore, history teaches us a great deal about how markets and governments work. One big lesson is that private property, free competition, and reputation normally deliver much better performance than public property, coercive monopoly, and faith in authority. Another big lesson is that despite textbook naysaying, markets have provided virtually every good you can imagine - including police, courts, and law. And as I mentioned in Q&A, company towns worked quite well in 19th-century America despite their bad press. History aside, we can learn a lot from standard economic reasoning. Given firms’ incentives, what should we expect them to do? If you think that private firms would always attack each other, why wouldn’t you think that independent governments would always attack each other? If you think independent governments can sustain lasting peace, why wouldn’t you think that private firms can sustain lasting peace? Before the debate, I wondered if Brook would advocate world government. Superficially, this solves the “lack of a final arbiter” problem. Since civil war is always possible, this is only a pseudo-solution. But I can still see the appeal. I quickly discovered that Brook has no problem with the existence of multiple independent governments, or even the existence of many small independent governments. Why don’t all of his fears about anarcho-capitalism apply equally to a world with many small independent governments? Brook’s only answer was that a monopoly of force within each geographical territory is crucial for peace. (And also, anarcho-capitalism where real estate developers bundle police and courts counts as “government”). What’s wrong with this answer? Simple: The smaller governments get, the more cross-border disputes you’ll have. If you rob a bank in Luxembourg, then flee to Belgium, how does the bank get justice? If you think small governments can amicably handle these disputes , why can’t private firms do the same? This question is especially pressing because Brook, like me, favors open borders. If people can move freely, they will - and so will their disputes. Brook granted that in a world of fully moral people, anarcho-capitalism would work. A minor concession? Hardly, because it means that all of his tautological arguments are simply false. If you can imagine functional anarcho-capitalism, then “anarcho-capitalism” can’t be a contradiction in terms. More importantly, once you grant that anarcho-capitalism would work with 100% moral people, this raises obvious questions: “Would it work with 99.9% moral people? How about 99%?” Once you legalize freedom, what share of the population will even remain “criminals”? Brook barely responded to my point that the distance from minarchy to anarcho-capitalism is miniscule. But like I said, once you have full freedom of contract, you should expect contracts to include binding arbitration clauses. And if arbitration is truly binding, there simply isn’t much for government to do. Don’t like a law? Write a contract appointing your brother as the arbiter. (Why would the other side sign? Because you give them a better price to compensate them, of course). If the distance from minarchy to anarcho-capitalism is so small, who cares? My best answer is that even the smallest government carries a high demagogic risk. Under minarchy, power-lusters will continue to turn to politics - and gradually rechart a course back to big government. In free markets, in contrast, what drives elites is not power-lust, but greed. Which, as my book in progress argues, is much better and much safer. In slogan form: Markets do the good things that sound bad; governments do the bad things that sound good. If we ever get to minarchy, refusing to take the final step into anarcho-capitalism would be short-sighted indeed.";1159
Anarcho-Capitalism Isn't Crazy, Just Ahead of Its Time;https://betonit.substack.com/p/anarcho-capitalism-isnt-crazy-just;"Thanks to everyone who watched the Brook-Caplan debate live on Monday! Great fun. The resolution was, “Anarcho-capitalism would definitely be a complete disaster for humanity.” Here’s my opening statement for the negative. We Don’t Need Global Minarchy “Anarcho-capitalism would definitely be a complete disaster for humanity.” My opponent, Yaron Brook, was the one who requested this strong resolution - not me. Still, if I was debating a normal economically illiterate human being before a normal economically illiterate audience, I’d be nervous. Fortunately, my opponent is a proponent of Ayn Rand’s Objectivism, and my audience is the Soho Forum. So we all agree on some basic principles of how markets work. Most notably: Rational self-interest plus free competition plus reputation normally equals excellent results for both consumers and producers. Since Ayn Rand and Yaron Brook embrace this principle, they are sanguine about what libertarians call “minarchy” - a society where government provides nothing except - to quote John Galt’s speech in Atlas Shrugged… the police, to protect you from criminals; the army, to protect you from foreign invaders; and the courts, to protect your property and contracts from breach or fraud by others, to settle disputes by rational rules, according to objective law. Now let’s imagine a glorious future when minarchy sweeps the world. Here is my question for Brook: When minarchy sweeps the world, will it be a “complete disaster for humanity” if multiple independent countries continue to exist? Yes or No? If you answer Yes, you’re obviously wrong. Before 1945, you might have argued with some plausibility that world government is the only way to avert World War III. Now we know better. Having multiple independent countries isn’t a “complete disaster for humanity” even in the philosophically corrupt, horribly statist world of today. Indeed, there is now a long list of adjacent countries where the probability of violent conflict is near-zero: the U.S. and Canada; Norway and Sweden; even - students of history, drop your jaws - France and Germany! So what? If you don’t answer Yes to “Will it be a complete disaster for humanity if multiple independent countries continue to exist?,” you’re stuck with No. And once you say No, the next obvious question is: Under minarchy, will it be a “complete disaster for humanity” if the world has a lot of small independent countries? If you say Yes, I’ll respond “Why?” If you say No, you’ve already accepted something that is functionally equivalent to one prominent version of anarcho-capitalism. The version I have in mind: A society where businesses contractually acquire sizable tracts of land, then provide police, courts, and so on as part of a package deal. When conflict spills across their “borders,” they adjudicate their disputes much as the U.S. and Canada do today. If you object, “The stronger business will just forcibly impose its will on the weaker business,” you’ve got to explain why the U.S. doesn’t just force its will on Canada. Which it obviously doesn’t. For a great many reasons. Most notably: (a) Both sides morally oppose using military force to resolve marginal disputes; (b) Peaceful diplomacy works tolerably well; (c) The costs of bloodshed exceed the gains, even for the winner. You could definitely argue that having lots of small countries in a minarchist world is somewhat inconvenient. Still, if you think minarchy would be a big improvement over the status quo, the net effect of moving from the world of today to a minarchist world with inconveniently small countries remains a major improvement. And a major improvement over the blatantly non-disastrous world of today is no disaster. Can you really say that this version of anarcho-capitalism and minarchy with lots of small countries are equivalent? There is only one notable difference: Unlike governments, businesses under anarcho-capitalism have to acquire all their land through voluntary contracts with individual property-owners. No eminent domain, no equivocation between democracy and voluntarism. The difference is, in Nozick’s word, historical: Did the system arise in a morally exemplary way? Functionally, however, it doesn’t matter. Once established, this version of anarcho-capitalism and minarchy with lots of small countries work the same way. “Regular” Anarcho-Capitalism What about “regular” anarcho-capitalism, where people get personal subscriptions to police, courts, and so on, instead of buying a package deal from their real estate developer? Once you concede that lots of small minarchic countries can peacefully resolve their “cross-border” disputes, we can go further. The “borders” don’t have to be geographical; they can be organizational. Right now, for example, if two customers of the same insurance company get into a car accident, the insurance company handles the dispute internally. If two customers of different insurance companies get into a car accident, the two insurance companies handle the dispute contractually. The economically illiterate will insist, “The companies will never agree; they’ll fight it out in court to the bitter end.” In the real world, however, the insurance industry has developed intricate adjudication systems that keep almost all their disputes out of the dysfunctional government courts. “Regular” anarcho-capitalism would work the same way. If two parties to a dispute subscribe to the same protection agency, the agency handles the dispute internally. Otherwise, the two agencies handle the dispute contractually. The economically illiterate will insist, “The agencies will never agree; they’ll fight it out in the streets to the bitter end.” But in an established anarcho-capitalist society, this makes about as much sense as worrying that Sweden will become a dictatorship and invade Norway. Which brings me to the Big Question of why Sweden won’t become a dictatorship and invade Norway. Because for most of its history, Sweden was a dictatorship and did repeatedly invade Norway. Here’s my answer to this Big Question. Suppose that in the year 1200 AD, a Swede gave a speech advocating democracy and calling for perpetual peace with Norway. I submit that all the other Vikings would have laughed at his naivety. They would have laughed at the idea of democracy: “If the strongest jarl doesn’t win the election, he’ll just murder the winner and take over.” And they would have laughed at the idea of perpetual peace with Norway: “Whatever the Norwegians say, they’ll invade at the first sign of weakness.” And in 1200 AD, the laughing Vikings would have been correct! When most people expect dictatorship and war, dictatorship and war are stable - and anyone who expects anything else seems crazy. Today, however, imagine that the prime minister of Sweden gave a speech advocating dictatorship and calling for an invasion of Norway. Not only would the other Swedes laugh at him; they’d assume he was trying to make them laugh. If the prime minister persisted, however, he would be peacefully removed from power. The lesson: In a society where most people expect democracy and peace, democracy and peace are stable - and anyone who expects anything else seems crazy. So what? If you claim that anarcho-capitalism would be a complete disaster for humanity if were tried today, I agree. But the problem isn’t that anarcho-capitalism fails to provide good incentives, or that the system “logically” collapses in gang warfare. The problem is expectations. Moving from stable democracy to stable anarcho-capitalism is like moving from stable dictatorship to stable democracy. Shifting expectations is very hard; but the problem is the transition, not the destination. Depressing? Kind of. The good news is that once we get to minarchy, the last step to anarcho-capitalism is miniscule. I’m going to end by showing you how miniscule. The Miniscule Step from Minarchy to Anarchy Under minarchy, government provides dispute resolution, rule formation, and enforcement. Many even claim that some or all of these functions must be a government monopoly. Yet none of these functions are monopolies even in the statist world of today. And most of what government does could easily be off-loaded to the private sector - especially when the private sector flourishes in the glorious light of laissez-faire. Dispute resolution. Even today, you don’t need government to resolve most disputes. If you allow binding private arbitration, almost everyone with a contractual relation will eagerly opt out of the court system. If government courts declared, “We don’t handle disputes between people with contractual relations; you should have included an arbitration clause,” even more folks will opt out. You near the final frontier when government judges say, “You’re total strangers? Fine, we’ll appoint an arbitrator. Good bye.” Rule formation. Even today, private arbitrators make their own rules. The main limit: No arbitration is truly binding, because the government can and will overrule you if displeased. Under minarchy, binding arbitration would have free rein, and government law-makers would have almost nothing left to do. Enforcement. Even today, private arbitrators enforce their own rulings through reputation, ostracism, and bonding. If you don’t pay your bills, the main sanction is just a bad credit rating. Under minarchy, again, arbitrators - and everyone else - could use these sanctions freely. The final frontier is when government courts say, “You signed a binding arbitration contract that allows them to jail you? Then I have no jurisdiction.” Almost everyone in this room is used to arguing for radical free-market policies. Almost everyone in this room knows the standard inventory of statist objections. Though I’m eager to answer your objections, I think you can answer most of them yourselves, using arguments you’ve already used a hundred times in other contexts. If you think adults should have the right to inject as much heroin as they want, and deny the results will be disastrous for humanity, you shouldn’t lose sleep over adults’ right to sign fully binding arbitration contracts. In “The Nature of Government,” Ayn Rand called anarchy a “floating abstraction,” but then claimed that anarcho-capitalism was even worse: One cannot call this theory a contradiction in terms, since it is obviously devoid of any understanding of the terms ""competition"" and ""government."" Nor can one call it a floating abstraction, since it is devoid of any con­tact with or reference to reality and cannot be concretized at all, not even roughly or approximately. If you’ve read Atlas Shrugged, you know she’s wrong. Why? Because Ayn Rand herself “concretized” anarcho-capitalism with great clarity. Remember Galt’s Gulch - Rand’s “Utopia of Greed”? Here’s how super-banker Midas Mulligan explained it: We are not a state here, not a society of any kind - we’re just a voluntary association of men held together by nothing but every man’s self-interest. I own the valley and I sell the land to others, when they want it. Judge Narragansett is to act as our arbiter, in case of disagreements. He hasn't had to be called upon as yet. They say that it's hard for men to agree. You'd be surprised how easy it is - when both parties hold as their moral absolute that neither exists for the sake of the other and that reason is their only means of trade. [emphasis mine] Fortunately, Rand asks too much. You don’t need enthusiastic support to sustain a political system; even reluctant fatalism will do. Democracy becomes stable once most people expect it to be stable. Minarchy will be stable once most people expect it to be stable. Anarcho-capitalism will be stable once most people expect it to be stable. If and when they do, there will be no “disaster for humanity.” Just the Second Renaissance.";1955
AI Illustration Contest: Who Won First Prize and How;https://betonit.substack.com/p/ai-illustration-contest-who-won-first;Last July, I announced $2000 in prizes for my AI Illustration Contest. The 1st-prize winner was a Venezuelan artist who works under the handle @DorianLudevig, aka Erickson L. Here are write-ups for the four runner-ups. Announcement: The second stage of the contest starts on October 1. The contest is open to the five finalists, plus up to TWO other artists selected by me. If you think you should be one of the two, please email me (a) your portfolio, and (b) a brief discussion of how you plan to combine human skill and AI to win. In stage 2, there are no runner-ups, just a $2000 prize for the winner. What are you up against? Here is the winning entry for stage one: What was the mix of AI and human skill involved? Here’s Dorian/Erickson in his own words: Technically it has not been necessary for me to go to the A.I. image generation tools to develop this page that I present in your contest. I'm pretty good at mastering traditional techniques, and those skills are still much more useful and practical to me today than what I can achieve with A.I. I tried designing some ideas using LEONARDO.AI , which is the image generator I've become most familiar with, but didn't get satisfactory results. The disproportions, and the lack of precision to obtain the result that is requested from the image generator is quite frustrating. Likewise, I have tried other image generators, and the same limitations are present to a greater or lesser extent in all of them. I think that for a person without very strong skills in the domain of drawing and artistic composition, artificial intelligence image generators can be very useful, because despite the fact that they present many flaws, they are still more efficient than what said user could achieve with his limited artistic skills. But in my personal case, the designs that I could get with the AI image generator lacked consistency, were unoriginal, very direct copies of traditional designs of other comic characters... and many people may not realize plagiarism so direct, but an artist with some experience and quite familiar with artistic styles can easily notice the lack of originality and creativity in the results obtained with the A.I. image generator. I resorted to my traditional way of working, looking for sources of inspiration from other works, I analyzed some elements of the artist Jean Giraud Moebius, some Marvel comics, and took into account P. Craig Russell's Ring of the Nibelung adaptation as a reference. And here is a comparison that has been presented in the debates on the mimicry of artificial intelligence, which justifies that it cannot be considered plagiarism since artists also feed from external sources... It is true that most amateur artists apply direct mimicry due to a lack of experience, but an artist with a reasonable level of experience has learned to discover their own methods to digest the reference sources from which they draw inspiration to transform it into a process. Of much more elastic reinterpretations and not in an obvious process of copying ideas. To give an example, it will be difficult to explain why this is something difficult to understand with words, it is something very visual: When I see a graphic element that seems very interesting to me in one work, I can use that same graphic element to apply it in another concept very different from that of the work from which I was inspired... or inversely many times it is not the graphic element that is special, but rather the concept that is hidden in said element, and it is precisely that concept that I end up using to apply it in another graphic situation very different from that of the work that served as a source of inspiration... situations that arise in the artist's creative process are too subjective. With the modest experience that I have using A.I., I have not managed to achieve that versatile creation form, it is like working with a severed or chained hand, when using A.I. But although I don't have a lot of experience using A.I., I have been very aware of what other artists who are much more immersed in artificial intelligence do, and without a doubt many others do achieve much more interesting things... but also mimicry in those works is still very rigid, in almost everything I've seen generated with A.I. For greater efficiency THE IMAGE GENERATOR requires training, and that is something I did not resort to... for practical reasons, training the IMAGE GENERATOR requires time and work. For this first stage, the time lapses were not viable to experiment with this whole process... without a doubt it was much more practical for me to resort to my traditional skills, which I dominate quite well. Although in any case if you consider that it is essential, I am open to the opening, to apply the AI at a certain more advanced stage of the project. Since I believe that at an already advanced stage of the project, artificial intelligence may be more useful, since it needs a good base of original material previously designed in a traditional way to be oriented and fed... and not the other way around. The A.I. are a new tool with a lot of potential, but the Tools are not the essence of artistic work, they are just a resource to lean on. And here is one of the big problems, why the results generated by this technology do not go beyond just being some peculiar attempts at artistic imitation... the real artists have not had much interest, and it is the artists who can use that tool to make true works of art... And on the contrary, many people outside the field of art or with limited experience and knowledge in said field, are the ones who have seen the opportunity to become an artist with the use of this tool, but it is a false illusion. These same users are not interested before acquiring the minimum that is needed in previous artistic skills and knowledge... because you have to understand and use A.I. for what it is, one more tool to enhance art, instead of seeing it as a magical entity that came to replace and make obsolete the most conventional art. I saw clear examples in this contest, most of the participants who used A.I. limited themselves to leaving all the work in the hands of that technological resource. One participant made a lot of emphasis that he needed more time for the training of the A.I., but once the A.I. reached such training, he would have the ability to generate each art consistently in an industrial way… I wonder what material he was planning would fuel that workout? I think that his plan could give very interesting results if the material he had in mind to fuel the training of the AI was a good cocktail of carefully worked design... cocktail prepared by a true artist. On the contrary, if that cocktail from 0 were a recycling of images downloaded from the Internet cloud, or directly taken from the same A.I. image generator, the results will always be mediocre. Finally, my process was not special, I looked at previous references from other artists to guide me, I began to draw the first designs of the 3 characters freehand, once I had the costumes finalized, I began to sketch the pages using the CLIP STUDIO PAINT program, with my HUION HS611 TABLET… after having the sketches coherently proportioned, draw in an overlay layer all the final ink scheme… and once having all the linear structure of the unicolor inking… finish with the color layers and the last details of brightness and shadows.;1325

Two Trips to Japan;https://betonit.substack.com/p/two-trips-to-japan;I’m planning a second visit to Japan with my younger son, Simon, in early December. Another meet-up with ACX Tokyo is in the works, but I’m also available for additional events throughout the country. My tentative plan is to go north to Nikko, then hit Kyoto, Kobe, and Nara, then head far south to Nagasaki, Kumamoto, and Kagoshima. Any readers in any of those cities who want to organize an event? Please email me. I’m also hoping to visit Japan again during the summer. For that to work, however, I’d like to find a position at a Japanese university, think tank, or other friendly institution. Three of my books have been translated into Japanese (though not the one that Japan arguable needs the most), so someone in the country must like my work! I understand that foreigners have major issues earning money in Japan, but I assume that paying my family’s expenses would be allowed. A four-week appointment would be ideal, but I’m flexible. Ideas? Again, please email me.;177
Open Borders: The Mock Trial;https://betonit.substack.com/p/open-borders-the-mock-trial;Inherit the Wind I’ve done scores of public debates, but my last mock trial was the case of Hansel and Gretel back in Ms. Niederreiter’s 7th-grade English class. Until FreedomFest 2023, when I was an expert witness for Open Borders. The full line-up: Michael Shermer (judge)  Larry Elder (prosecution attorney) Jim Geraghty (prosecution witness) Jan Janielek (prosecution witness) Catherine Bernard (defense attorney) Bryan Caplan (defense witness) Jacob Hornberger (defense witness) The trial was a weird but thrilling experience. Weird, because unlike a debate, I never got to speak to the expert prosecution witnesses (except pleasantries in the green room). Thrilling, because my teammates were much better than me. In private, Jacob Hornberger is a mild-mannered guy. On stage, he’s a rock star. Enjoy the full video. And defense attorney Catherine Bernard was cinematic. A legal personage straight out of Paths of Glory or Inherit the Wind. Spoiler: I don’t know how the jurors were picked. FreedomFest audiences are known for leaning right, but jurors had to avow their own open-mindedness on the issue of open borders. The exact vote was never revealed, but my team won. Enjoy!;195
Intellectual Autobiography of Bryan Caplan;https://betonit.substack.com/p/intellectual-autobiography-of-bryan;"Back in 2003, I wrote this for Walter Block’s I Chose Liberty: Autobiographies of Contemporary Libertarians. I’m planning on extending by the end of this academic year (though I kind of already did). Enjoy! High School It began with Ayn Rand, as it proverbially does.  I was in 11th grade journalism class with Matt Mayers, my friend since the age of six.  The course was the most notoriously undemanding in Granada Hills High School, leaving ample time for free reading.  While I devoured Nietzsche’s Thus Spoke Zarathustra - and got through The Brothers Karamazov and Faust with less youthful exuberance - Matt read Atlas Shrugged.  One day he turned around in his chair and told me “Read this part.  You’ll like it.”  It was Francisco d’Anconia’s speech on money, and I rushed through it in fifteen exciting minutes.  But for unclear reasons, I didn’t begin reading Atlas until the last week of summer before my senior year.  If memory serves me, I raced through its thousand-plus pages in three largely sleepless days. I would not call myself an instant convert.  But I did start what I call “trying on her ideas for size.”  When opportunity presented itself - or when I cornered my parents or friends or teachers or random fellow students - I played devil’s advocate for Rand’s Objectivism.   After a couple of months - a long time in the intellectual life of a teenager - I was not playing devil’s advocate any longer.  I was convinced that her philosophy was by and large correct. From there, I branched out to other libertarian works.  Rand, of course, rarely recommended anything written by someone other than herself, but some liberty-loving soul had donated a copy of John Hospers’ Libertarianism: A Political Philosophy for Tomorrow (1971) to my local public library.  While I doubt I would find Hospers’ book impressive today, at the time it was a thrilling read.  I had never heard the “standard libertarian arguments” before.  Price floors cause surpluses?  It was never mentioned in my semester-long 12th-grade economics course.  The minimum wage therefore causes involuntary unemployment?  A shocking thought.  It was obvious once Hospers pointed it out, but these ideas were never even ridiculed by my liberal teachers.  They were unheard of. Every history teacher I could remember had told me that pharmaceutical regulation was a great blessing, sparing us a generation of Thalidomide babies and God knows what else.  Reading the standard libertarian rebuttal - delaying beneficial drugs kills far more people than approving ineffective or even harmful ones - made my head spin.  If I asked my teachers “Is there any argument an intelligent person might make against the FDA?” I doubt one of them could have articulated this retrospectively obvious objection. As I digested the stock of libertarian insight, I noticed a phenomenon central to my mature research: Most people violently rejected even my most truistic arguments.  Yes, I was a shrill teenager, but it seems like anyone should have recognized the potential downside of drug regulation once I pointed it out.  Instead, they yelled louder about Thalidomide babies.  True, it was not a complete surprise - I had already experienced the futility of trying to convert my family and friends to atheism during the prior year.  But I was frustrated to find that human beings were almost as dogmatic about politics and economics as they were about religion and philosophy. In those dark days before the World Wide Web, it was not easy for a seventeen-year-old to get information about intriguing ideas, much less converse with real-life proponents.  But I mailed away for information from the Ayn Rand Institute and the Libertarian Party, and they ultimately plugged me into an array of social/ideological networks.  Through ARI I learned of the existence of “The Forum for the New Intellectual,” a monthly Objectivist discussion group that met at a bank in downtown LA.  I began attending regularly.  I wound up having little to do with the Libertarian Party - the one “supper club” I attended seemed far too practical! - but one of the members turned me on to Austrian economics in general and Murray Rothbard in particular. Luckily for me, I took a couple of classes at Cal State Northridge during my last semester of high school.  That meant that I had a university library card, which in turn meant that I could check out a mountain of fascinating books in philosophy, economics, politics, history, and psychology.  Soon I had read Man, Economy, and State as well as Human Action.  But it was Rothbard’s defense of anarcho-capitalism in For a New Liberty that shocked me.  It had to be wrong. I started asking everyone at the Forum for the New Intellectual to tell me why Rothbard was mistaken.  (I had already been underwhelmed by Nozick’s response in Anarchy, State, and Utopia). Contrary to the Randians’ intolerant image, many were happy to engage me.  One, Paul Beaird, informed me that he refuted Roy Child’s defense of anarcho-capitalism back in the ‘70’s.  Beaird immediately ran off copies of both Child’s “Open Letter to Ayn Rand” (Childs 1994) and its putative refutation.  I was not impressed by the latter, but loved Childs’ lucid and to-the-point essay.  I even got the skeptical Matt Mayers to read it, and he too was favorably impressed.  Two high school seniors sharing a pizza, judging the practicality and morality of anarcho-capitalism - it doesn't get any better. The summer of 1989, I finished high school and attended two conferences.  The first was the Mises Institute’s summer seminar at Stanford University.  It was there that I met Murray Rothbard for the first time, still in his prime.  I remember his opening lecture, containing the memorable adage that “The more consistently Austrian an economist is, the better a writer he will be.”  (He generously appended that you should adjust for the writer’s native language!)  I did all I could to maximize my time in Rothbard’s presence.  I still recall the excitement of seeing a draft of Rothbard’s latest essay, overlaid with his hand-written edits, and challenging him on the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan.  A year later, a friend asked how I had endured the “Stalinist” intolerance of the Mises Institute’s conference.  While there were a couple of faculty who brooked no contradiction, it was hardly a pervasive feature of my week at Stanford.  I still recall Walter Block telling the eighteen-year-old me to drop “Prof. Block” in favor of “Walter.”  But “true believer” hysteria did permeate the second conference I attended that summer - the Jefferson School.  Run by Objectivist economist George Reisman with the sanction of the Ayn Rand Institute, my intellectual digestion at the Jefferson School was soured by the fallout from ARI’s recent purge of David Kelley.  (Kelley’s original offense was speaking to non-Objectivist libertarian audiences; he sealed his fate with a punchy essay defending “the virtue of tolerance” from an Objectivist perspective.[1])  The conference closed with an emotional lecture by Leonard Peikoff on the evil of Kelley and everyone who thought he had a point. 1989 College Soon afterwards I began my studies at the University of California at Berkeley. At the time, I thought of myself as an Objectivist in philosophy and an Austrian in economics.  But in both cases, I already had my list of reservations.  As my education  - a major in economics and a minor in philosophy - proceeded, my lists of objections grew.  By the time I left Berkeley, I had dropped both labels.  My undergraduate deconversion from Objectivism and Austrianism, though, was nothing like my high school deconversion from Christianity.  I rejected Christianity because I determined that it was, to be blunt, idiotic.  I rejected Objectivism and Austrianism, in contrast, as mixtures of deep truths and unfortunate mistakes.  Let me begin with the deep truths.  The Objectivists were right to insist that reality is objective, human reason able to grasp it, and skepticism without merit.  They correctly held that humans have free will, morality is objective, and the pursuit of self-interest typically morally right.  Rand’s politics was also largely on target: laissez-faire capitalism is indeed the only just social system, socialism is institutionalized slavery, and the welfare state’s attempt to reconcile these poles is a travesty.  What about the deep truths of the Austrians?  Perhaps the most valuable, to my mind, was their view - perhaps only implicit - that economists should focus on big questions, not the picayune minutiae that fill most academic journals.  I always roll my eyes when someone alludes Keynes’ hope that economists make themselves “as useful as dentists.”  The Austrians were right to emphasize elementary economic theory and introspection, and downplay mathematics and econometrics.  In the field of industrial organization, they wisely rejected the perfectly competitive benchmark, arguing that the crucial issue is not how many firms exist in an industry, but whether government legally hinders competition.  In labor and macro, they always remembered the inextricable link between unemployment and excessive real wages.  A recurring Austrian lesson is that markets often work well even though economists have trouble understanding how they could work at all.  (Ebay is a case in point.  Ten years ago, I bet that 80% of economists would have declared it impossible by reason of asymmetric information!) Now let us turn to the unfortunate mistakes.  During my undergraduate years, I spent far more time reading and thinking than writing.  But two essays that appeared while I was in graduate school - “Why I Am Not an Objectivist” (by Michael Huemer), and “Why I Am Not an Austrian Economist” (by myself) - ultimately articulated the main objections I formed as an undergraduate.  Michael Huemer was a fellow Berkeley student, and the most powerful influence on my mature philosophical outlook; he is now a philosophy professor at the University of Colorado.  You might say that Huemer provided a modern restatement of the Scottish philosophy of common sense, best represented by Thomas Reid, but this seriously understates the originality of Huemer’s contribution.  In any case, like Reid, Huemer maintains that philosophers’ great error is to set up inherently unfulfillable standards for knowledge, and then turn to skepticism once they realize that their beliefs fall short of these standards.  As Reid puts it: [W]hen we attempt to prove, by direct argument, what is really self-evident, the reasoning will always be inconclusive; for it will either take for granted the thing to be proved, or something not more evident; and so, instead of giving strength to the conclusion, will rather tempt those to doubt of it who never did so before. (1872, p.637) I do not think that Rand would have objected to Reid’s basic point.  She maintained that there were three self-validating axioms - “Existence exists,” “Consciousness is conscious,” “A is A.”  But for Reid and Huemer, the set of knowledge-not-in-need-of-proof is more expansive.  In particular, it includes some moral truths.  It is obvious, for example, that murder is wrong.  If someone denied that it was obvious, what argument could convince him? Rand of course thought she had an argument for the wrongness of murder (see “The Objectivist Ethics” in Rand (1964)).  The more I reflected, though, the more I realized that her “man qua man” standard was question-begging.  If Rand did not approve of an action that seemed plainly conducive to one’s self-interest, she declared it contrary to the life of “man qua man.”  The Reid-Huemer route was to openly recognize the wrongness of murder as an independent moral fact.  In the admittedly rare circumstances where murder serves one’s self-interest, it remains wrong. Huemer resolved my philosophical doubts so well that I became less and less interested in pursuing a career in philosophy.  I lost all urge to convince other academics that they were not brains in vats.  My interest in economics, on the other hand, remained level.  Yet the more I studied, the more disenchanted I became with Austrian economics.  Years later, after completing my dissertation, I explained why in the webbed essay “Why I Am Not an Austrian Economist.” Perhaps the main problem with Austrian economics is that it is not introspectivist enough.  Mises and Rothbard insisted that economists could only recognize preferences “revealed in action.”  Rothbard used this principle to attack several pillars of modern neoclassical economics.  These ranged from the most abstract to the most applied.  He rejected indifference curves because action always reveals preference, never indifference; he insisted that voluntary trade was always Pareto-improving, because participants demonstrate by their actions that they are better off, while grumbling bystanders do not; and he denied that government action could ever be Pareto-improving, because the need to use coercion proves that at least one person is demonstrably worse off.  What became increasingly evident to me was that the Austrian equation of preference and action is crude behaviorism.  I know by introspection that I have preferences that I fail to act upon.  And while I do not have telepathy, it is overwhelmingly probable that the same holds for my fellow human beings.  Once you grant this principle, the most distinctive Austrian doctrines crumble. I found the Austrians’ resistance to probability theory almost equally objectionable.  Mises and Rothbard saw no role for quantifiable probabilities outside of games of chance and actuarial tables.[2]  They insisted that it was impossible to assign numerical probabilities to unique events.  I unthinkingly accepted their view until the summer of 1992, when Michael Huemer pointed out its absurdity.  Probabilities are nothing more than degrees of belief, which we know are real from introspection. Sorting out my views on Objectivist philosophy and Austrian economics took up the majority of my undergraduate reflection.  But my interests remained eclectic, and I read widely, especially in history, epistemology, and political philosophy.  I eagerly studied the history of Communism while I watched its death throes on the news.  Learning about horrific events such as Stalin’s terror-famine in the Ukraine enriched my political outlook.  This tragedy helped me appreciate the logical conclusion of collectivist ideas:  Rand’s equation of socialism with slavery was no hyperbole.  At the same time, though, knowing the history of Communism helped me realize how much worse our political situation could become.  To this day, I am baffled by libertarians who read the newspaper or watch the news every day, gritting their teeth at the latest petty injustice.  Why do they torment themselves so?  I save my moral outrage for Hitler, Stalin, and Mao.  And immigration restrictions.  I lost a lot of respect for Rothbard around 1990 when he reversed his lifelong support for free immigration.  If anything ever deserved Rothbard's classic ""monstrous!"" denunciation, it is our ""kinder, gentler"" Berlin Wall built to keep people from living and working in the U.S. because they happened to be born elsewhere.  Rothbard had always refused to justify one injustice with another, but overnight the welfare system became his rationale for cutting immigration below its already heavily restricted level.  When Libertarian Party presidential candidate Ed Clark made the same argument in 1980, Rothbard was outraged, citing it as ""probably the greatest (or perhaps the second greatest) single scandal of the Clark campaign"": Note, also, how Clark has been brought to this shameful point of having locked himself into a measured, prepared order of destatization.  He has already asserted that we can't slash the welfare state until we have achieved ""full employment""; he now adds that we can't have free and open immigration until we eliminate the welfare state.  And so it goes; the ""gradualists"" lock us permanently into the status quo of statism.[3] After being let down by Mr. Libertarian, I was pleasantly surprised by one of his intellectual antipodes, the MIT-trained economist Bill Dickens.  As my Econ 1 instructor at UC Berkeley, Bill was already well-known as half of the brains behind the Akerlof-Dickens model of cognitive dissonance; he later won prominence for his research on nominal wage rigidity with Akerlof and Perry, and his work with James Flynn (of the “Flynn effect”) on IQ and heritability.  Dickens was far from libertarian, but rich in professorial virtues: thoughtful, opinionated, open-minded, curious, and generous with his time.  He happily supervised my independent study on the critics of Keynesianism, often spending over an hour with me every week to point me in new directions and challenge me to do better.   In my senior year, I was still undecided about my future.  I loved economics, but often hated the economics profession for being picayune, scientistic, and statist.  Perhaps, I thought, I should go to law school and pursue ideas in my spare time.  I kept my options open, taking both the LSAT (for law school) and the GRE (for graduate school).  I finally chose the path of hope and applied to Ph.D. programs in economics.  Introspection feels unreliable to me here, but I recall re-experiencing the love of economics as I first read Posner’s Economic Analysis of Law in 1992.  I wound up accepting Princeton University’s offer, largely for the narrowly economic reason that it was the only top-five program to offer me tuition and money. The other noteworthy intellectual event of Berkeley education was my senior thesis.  Under the loose guidance of Robert Cooter in the law school, I wrote a hundred-page monograph on “The Economics of Non-State Legal Systems.”  In it, I analyzed privatization in dispute resolution, rule formation, and enforcement.  It was, in essence, a synthesis of Posner’s law-and-economics with Rothbard’s defense of anarcho-capitalism.  Unlike Rothbard, though, I tried to unbundle the various aspects of legal privatization, in the dual hope of better understanding how a free market would work in this industry, and being more persuasive to skeptics. Serendipity struck the summer before graduate school when an internship at the Friedrich Naumann Stiftung in Germany fell through.  Tom Palmer at the Institute for Humane Studies swiftly paved the way for a summer internship in beautiful Fairfax, Virginia.  The summer fellows program, directed by philosopher Rod Long, was a joyous intellectual experience.  The staff at IHS, especially Walter Grinder and Tom Palmer, Rod Long, and the other fellows made every day fun.  Lurking beneath that fun, however, was a mighty boost for my long-run career.  IHS invited weekly speakers.  One of them was Prof. Tyler Cowen of George Mason, who discussed draft chapters of what eventually became his In Praise of Commercial Culture.  At the after-talk lunch, I steered the discussion to his recent critique of anarcho-capitalism published in Economics and Philosophy (Cowen 1992).   I soon wrote a response and showed it to him, along with my undergraduate thesis.  Tyler, a born contrarian, liked arguing with me.  He told me to keep George Mason in mind once I finished my Ph.D. Graduate School In choosing Princeton’s Ph.D. program, I knowingly took the path of short-term pain for long-run gain.  Like all top departments, Princeton econ was long on math and short on economic intuition.  I tried to make the best of it: do an adequate job in my classes and satisfy my curiosity with free reading.  I also plugged into an array of early Internet mailing lists on libertarianism, Objectivism, and anarchism, and played countless hours of Sid Meier’s Civilization.  I kept up numerous email discussions with my friends, including many with Tyler Cowen and literally hundreds with Bill Dickens.  All-in-all, the first year was bad, but not as bad as expected.  After I married my college girlfriend, Corina Mateescu, in the summer of 1994, I felt that everything was looking up for me. The remaining years at Princeton passed quickly.  Applied game theory was valuable, and Ben Bernanke’s monetary class was superb.  Donald Wittman’s Myth of Democratic Failure greatly impressed me, making me reflect on the inadequacies of public choice theory.  But my hobbies were my passion.  I set up my first webpage to warehouse my growing body of writings.  I wrote an Anarchist Theory FAQ to dispassionately compare and contrast “left-wing” and “right-wing” anarchism, much to the outrage of anarcho-socialists on the Usenet group alt.society.anarchy.  I later became a mini-expert on the Spanish Civil War and wrote the polemical essay “The Anarcho-Statists of Spain.”  Thanks to publicity on various leftist websites, it became the Usenet equivalent of a best-seller, getting thousands of hits.  I also taught myself Perl programming to set up my first webbed survey, “The Libertarian Purity Test.”   Another feature I added later - ultimately becoming my website’s biggest draw - was the online Museum of Communism, dedicated to exposing the horrors of Marxist-Leninist regimes.[4] In my spare time, I did what I was supposed to be doing, writing a “plain vanilla” dissertation on the economics of state and local government.  It was an unpleasant experience, but I picked up the basics of academic writing and finished the Ph.D. in four years, so I have no cause for complaint.  When I went on the job market, my earlier contact with Tyler Cowen served me well.  I had nine interviews, one fly-out at George Mason, and one offer from George Mason.  As in marriage, I reflected, it only takes one. Living the Dream The position at Mason was my big break.  From the outset, I knew that I had to navigate between two dangers: (1) failing to publish and thus perishing, or (2) wasting my life writing boring, plain vanilla papers.[5]  In retrospect, I struck a good balance.  I turned all of my dissertation chapters into articles and put them in the mail.  I then initiated new lines of research, tied together by the common theme of voter irrationality.  Since I was at Mason, I felt free to be creative before getting tenure. Donald Wittman’s work, showing how rational voters (in the rational expectations sense of the word) could easily make democracy work well, had already inadvertently convinced me that voters are not rational.  I began to wonder: If a voter has no chance of changing electoral outcomes, why would he strive to be rational?  Geoffrey Brennan and Loren Lomasky’s wonderful work on expressive voting, Democracy and Decision, helped me visualize the expansive implications of voter indecisiveness.  Inspired by these two works, I began years of fruitful reading and writing.  I discovered empirical public opinion research, and learned that political scientists had long since debunked economists’ silly cliche that voters maximize their financial self-interest.  I struck gold when I realized that an already-existing data set, the Survey of Americans and Economists on the Economy, had not been used to test for the rationality of voter beliefs - but could be.  Working with this data gave me my first taste of the joy of empirical research.  Too much of the empirical work I saw at Princeton was little more than using econometrics to shoehorn the facts into preconceived molds.  As I analyzed the data on economic beliefs, I felt like I was unearthing novel facts about the world. The underlying goal of my research on voter irrationality, in brief, is to resurrect the 1970’s Chicago “markets good, government bad” consensus.  This intuitively plausible view has fallen out of favor in academic economics, largely because its defenders blamed too much on special interests.  The real problem with democracy is not that special interests frustrate the will of the people.  It is, rather, that people are smart as consumers but stupid as voters. Though my position seems novel to other academics, anyone who knows my intellectual history should not be surprised.  Rand, Mises, Rothbard - all three held that statist ideas were false, widespread, and politically influential.  This gives them a clean explanation for what is wrong with the world and how to fix it.  The problem with government policy is not that the majority is right and ignored, but that it is wrong and heeded. Mises puts it well: The world inclines to Socialism because the great majority of people want it.  They want it because they believe that Socialism will guarantee a higher standard of living.  The loss of this conviction would signify the end of Socialism. (1981, p.462) Rand is still more eloquent: Look around you: what you have done to society, you had done it first within your soul; one is the image of the other.  The dismal wreckage, which is now your world, is the physical form of the treason you committed to your values, to your friends, to your defenders, to your future, to your country, to yourself. (1957, p.984) While Atlas Shrugged is a work of fiction, John Galt’s analysis of the cause of social and economic collapse is clearly her own.  Indeed, after living through Lenin’s takeover, Rand might have longed to say these very words to her fellow Russians. Both my dissertation and my post-dissertation papers sold well.  In fact, the papers written to satisfy my own curiosity sold better than the papers written to satisfy the expected referee.  The more lines I added to my vita, the more confident I felt to branch out to whatever questions interested me.  I noticed a connection between my work on voter irrationality and the puzzle of “why poor countries stay poor.”  So I voraciously read the growth and development literature, and wrote “The Idea Trap.”  I later became curious about personality psychology.  So I learned all I could on the subject, and wrote “Stigler-Becker vs. Myers-Briggs.”  The intellectual latitude I now enjoy exceeds all my hopes.  Indeed, I often delve into subjects purely out of curiosity, as I have since my teens.  For example, I consume mass quantities of research on human intelligence and behavioral genetics.  It would be good if they gave me new topics for professional papers.  But even if they never do, these are areas worth understanding. The quality of my colleagues immediately rose when I moved from Princeton to George Mason, and improved every year.  A few of my fellow students at Princeton, especially Jim Schneider, were excellent friends and debating partners.  But most of the students at Princeton were what I dismissively call “careerists,” and in spite of their high IQs, the Princeton faculty - with the notable exception of Ben Bernanke - were sadly narrow.  At Mason, I found colleagues - faculty and students alike - who love talking about economics as much as I do.  Tyler Cowen, Pete Boettke, Robin Hanson, Don Boudreaux, Alex Tabarrok - they are among my favorite intellectuals on the planet.  We argue non-stop, and I wouldn’t have it any other way.  Once we agree, it is time to change the subject. The last two years, I have been writing a book on voter irrationality, plus half a dozen other projects.  I should officially have tenure by May.  Research has slowed down a bit since my twin sons Aidan and Tristan were born, but that doesn’t worry me.  I am looking forward to a lifetime of thinking about the Big Questions and going wherever my curiosity takes me. 2003 References Caplan, Bryan.  ""Bryan Caplan Homepage.""

Semi-Intellectual;https://betonit.substack.com/p/semi-intellectual;"After Robin and I interviewed the Lewis brothers, they both wrote detailed replies. Here’s my reply to Hyrum Lewis’ reply. He’s in blockquotes, I’m not. 1. What are the three best bodies of evidence in your favor? …We’ve found that these three lines of evidence (each backed by numerous studies) best militate in favor of our position: Historical: Even a cursory look at history shows that what is considered left and right is always changing. Pro-market used to be considered “liberal” (e.g., Jefferson and Jackson) and then later was considered “conservative” (e.g., Taft and Reagan). Militarism used to be considered “liberal” (Wilson, Roosevelt, Truman—remember all those “right-wing” isolationists who didn’t want to get involved in WWII?) and then later it was considered “conservative” (Reagan and W. Bush). If some positions were essentially “conservative” then we would see conservatives embracing those positions across time and space. We don’t, indicating that there are no essentially conservative (or liberal) positions. This is one example of why I’m convinced that you’re overstating, Hyrum. Suppose the “left” and “right” views change by 1% per century. I say that’s good evidence that essentialism is almost exactly true. Suppose that “left” and “right” views change by 1% per day. I say that’s good evidence is essentialism is almost totally false. The real world is in-between; therefore, the sensible position is also in-between. Laboratory: Scholars have shown that they can get ideologues to switch positions simply by priming them with social cues. So if experimenters tell self-described “conservatives” that Donald Trump supports the minimum wage, those conservatives also support the minimum wage; if they tell self-described “conservatives” that Trump opposes the minimum wage, those conservatives also oppose the minimum wage (and the more conservative someone is, the more likely they are to follow the social cues). If support for the minimum wage grew out of an essential conservative philosophy or disposition, conservatives would draw their positions from that essence. They don’t. They draw it from their social group. Reasonable, but notice that when intellectuals fail to respond to priming and proclaim their continued loyalty to “true conservatism” or “true liberalism,” you refuse to count this as evidence in favor of essentialism. Why not? Survey: When we survey Americans about their individual political positions, we find no correlation between issues considered liberal (such as belief in abortion rights and belief in redistribution of wealth) except among those most socialized into believing in the political spectrum. If abortion rights and redistribution went together naturally because they both shared a left-wing essence, we would expect to see people holding those views in a package, regardless of their exposure to the left-right paradigm. “No correlation”? Or just weak correlations? Again, I maintain that if “no correlation” supports the extreme version of your story, then a “weak correlation” slightly undermines that extreme version. The correct view is that the left-right spectrum is semi-intellectual. Largely social, but combined with some amateurish philosophizing. 6.a. Aren’t you holding essentialists to too high of a bar?  I don’t think so because we are holding them to the bar of falsification, which is what separates rationality from dogmatism and science from religion. All scholarly theories must be, in principle, falsifiable and yet the essentialist position has been, in our view, soundly falsified. This is probably the most fundamental difference between us. I maintain that falsificationism is an absurd philosophy of science. No one - including you - applies it consistently. Essentialists could just as easily use falsificationism to “refute” you as you use it to “refute” them. Why is falsificationism an absurd philosophy of science? “One failed prediction falsifies the theory” is the slogan. Yet even the strongest theories in physics get falsified every day. After all, high school students run experiments on Newtonian motion - and their results routinely contradict the theory! The common-sense/Bayesian response is to scoff, “What’s more likely - that basic physics is wrong, or that high school students made mistakes?” In practice, professed falsificationists join in the scoffing. But they do so despite their philosophy of science, not because of it. After all, once you declare, “Only a careful/skillful/reputable counter-example falsifies the theory,” people can cling to a theory by declaring counter-examples to be careless, unskilled, or disreputable. Then critics have to engage these declarations instead of just pointing confidently to the failed prediction. Once we move away from natural sciences, falsificationism is even more absurd. Why do social scientists even bother doing statistics? Because no theory in social science perfectly fits the facts! In other words: Every one of our theories is easy to falsify. A devoted falsificationism has to jettison all of social science. The common-sense response, however, is to scoff, “So what? Social scientists should just use the least-bad theories we’ve got until better ones come along.” If you ask, “Better by what standard?,” the answer is: “Better fits the totality of the evidence.” This, not falsificationism, is what “separates rationality from dogmatism and science from religion.” Corollary: If the totality of evidence is already large, we shouldn’t dramatically revise our views in response to any specific fact. I’m happy to move from saying the Lewis brothers are 85% right to saying they’re 85.3% right. But it would be crazy to discover one new political fact that move from 85% to 100%. Unconvinced, Hyrum? How would you respond if an essentialist announced, “The social theory predicts that issue positions will have a correlation of 0. The true correlation is .07, which soundly falsifies the social theory”? I predict that you would be unpersuaded. As you should be. Invoking falsificationism is tantamount to: “Hey everyone, let’s play this game with my stacked deck of cards.” So, let’s go back to your claim that leftists are essentially anti-market: What if the next president of the United States (with the help of a congress from his own party) was the most anti-market president in a generation—radically increasing spending, signing new economic regulations, running up debt, and significantly decreasing America’s “economic freedom” score—and yet the left hated him and the right loved him. Would this falsify your view that the left is essentially anti-market? If “anti-market” defined the left, then wouldn’t your theory predict that the left would love this extremely anti-market president? If so, then the presidency of George W. Bush has already falsified your claim. This brings me to another complaint about your book. While you make many sensible observations, you repeatedly treat totally debatable claims as established “facts.” According to the Fraser Institute’s measure, economic freedom was quite stable under George W. Bush. In 2000, the year before he took office, the U.S. score was 8.7/10. Four years later, it was still 8.7/10. In 2008, it was 8.33. That’s “the most anti-market president in a generation”? Furthermore, even if measured economic freedom plummeted under Bush, you could blame other branches of the government. (When my old colleague Vernon Smith chided Bush on tariffs, that’s precisely how Bush responded). Sure, you can object, “That’s what they all say.” I’m tempted to say so myself. But to treat the GWB’s performance as definitive proof of anything is deeply misguided. We don’t use a unidimensional spectrum in any other complex realm of life for good reason (there is no single “business spectrum,” “medical spectrum,” “recreation spectrum,” etc.), so why do we use one in politics? We shouldn’t. Actually, we use many such spectra. Masculine versus feminine. Smart versus stupid. Rich versus poor. None are perfect. Almost all are useful. 6.b. At any given time, leftist and rightist thinkers disagree, so there’s got to be some room for indeterminacy, right? Yes, all categories have indeterminacy at the margins. For instance, we could show that there is indeterminacy in the category “chair”—which we might define as “a human-made device for human sitting”—by pointing to marginal examples, such as dollhouse chairs or stumps around a campfire. But the left-right categories are not indeterminate at the margins, they are incoherent at their core. To show why, let’s go back once again to your “anti-market” essence: Adolf Hitler was not a marginal figure to the right; he’s considered the quintessential right winger—the purest, most perfect embodiment of the right-wing essence taken to its logical conclusion. Again, you overstate. Leftists will often say this. Very few self-identified rightists will. Indeed, most rightists who confront this issue normally argue that Hitler was “really” a leftist. Check out this little poll I did: And yet he was a proud socialist who believed in government nationalization of private industry and vast redistributions of wealth. Hitler was, by any measure extremely anti-market. So, according to the “anti-market” essence, Hitler should be on the “far left” (his anti-market views were even more extreme than the most radical Democrats today). The same is true of Tojo, Mussolini, and many other quintessential “far right” figures of the past century. These are some of the big facts that motivate my Simplistic Theory of Left and Right. To repeat my position: The unifying idea behind leftism is antipathy for markets; the unifying idea behind rightism is antipathy for the left. The rest, on my account, is incidental. Hitler, Tojo, and Mussolini all count as right-wing despite their anti-market policies because they loudly criticized the left - and imprisoned and murdered many leftists for being leftists. (Why don’t all of the millions of leftists Stalin murdered move him to the right-wing camp? Partly because he was far more anti-market than Hitler, Tojo, or Mussolini, but mainly because he explicitly killed leftists because they weren’t leftist enough!) Donald Trump is not a marginal figure to the right; he’s considered the quintessential American right winger—a “far right” ideologue who captured the Republican Party and drove it to its extreme right wing—and yet Trump is far more anti-market than was Bill Clinton. Another debatable claim stated as fact. Here’s a standard measured of the growth of regulation by year: Yes, Trump has a huge spike in 2020. Covid, man. Almost anyone would have. Otherwise, Trump’s average looks lower than any president’s since Reagan. He also passed a major tax cut. Misleading? Arguably. Using better measures, perhaps Trump was more anti-market than Clinton. But you speak as if this is an obvious fact that totally vindicates you. It’s not and it doesn’t. So why does the left despise Trump and praise Clinton? When Trump and Bush moved the Republican Party in a more anti-market direction, we were told that they had both moved the party “to the right.” It seems to me that if your “anti-market” essentialist claim were correct, the consensus would be that Bush and Trump had moved the party “to the left.” More thoughtful leftists repeatedly acknowledge that Trump isn’t clearly right-wing. Back in 2015, Ezra Klein called him “the perfect moderate.” In 2020, New York Magazine ran a story called “Trump Isn’t a Moderate, But He Plays One on TV.” Of course, the falsifying evidence doesn’t stop there. Here’s more: The War on Terror: if the left is essentially “anti-market,” why did the left (more than the right) tend to oppose the War on Terror and national security state more generally even though its expenditures and government controls reduced economic freedom? The essentialist theory has no answer, the social theory does. My “semi-intellectual” story has an easy answer: This is one of the many issues where the social theory is true. Which doesn’t show that the social theory is the whole truth. Immigration: if the left is essentially “anti-market,” why does the left currently want more of a “market” in laborers from foreign countries? The essentialist theory has no answer, the social theory does. I’ve talked to quite a few pro-immigration leftists. Unless they’re economists, their main focus is not opening labor markets to international competition, but getting immigrants who are already here full access to government benefits. Furthermore, a lot of right-wing opposition to immigration is precisely that immigrants are coming for welfare, not work. Are these thoughtful positions? Not to my mind. But they are attempts to philosophically reconcile their specific issue positions with their general ideologies. Drugs, Gambling, and Prostitution: if the left is essentially “anti-market,” why is the left currently more in favor of free markets when it comes to drugs, prostitution, and gambling? The right says “drugs kill people so we have to regulate the sale of drugs”; the left says, “guns kill people so we have to regulate the sale of guns”—why the inconsistency? The essentialist theory has no answer, the social theory does. A big point in your favor. Tech companies: if the left is essentially “anti-market,” why was Trump’s proposal to control the “liberal” private-sector tech companies considered “right wing”? The essentialist theory has no answer, the social theory does. Most leftists - and many rightists - mock this as a betrayal of right-wing principle. I know you scoff at such rhetoric. But it still shows that what people “consider” right-wing is less clear than you think. Mitt Romney: if the left is essentially “anti-market,” why is Mitt Romney considered to be more moderate (and therefore further to “the left” on the political spectrum) than Donald Trump even though he is far more pro-market? The essentialist theory has no answer, the social theory does. If Romney had been elected, it’s not clear to me that he would have been more pro-market than Trump. Honestly, so many “facts” that seem clear to you seem murky to me. 11. You seem willing to accept sub-level essentialism, like “support for economic freedom” or “hawkish foreign policy.”  But don’t all of your arguments about the logical independence (or “granularity”) of issues apply here, too? Yes, but the difference is that some categories are accurate and useful and others are inaccurate and harmful. At risk of sounding like a broken record: “Accuracy” and “usefulness” lie on a continuum. If you were so inclined, you could easily “falsify” the constructs of “support for economic freedom” and “hawkish foreign policy.” Just point out numerous changes over time, priming effects, low correlations, and inconsistencies. 12. Quote from p.79 on raw tribalism versus intellectualized tribalism.  True? Perhaps you could be a bit more specific, but I think our main point is that the highly intellectual are more likely to be tribal when it comes to politics because the essentialist myth is upheld by ex post storytelling and intellectuals are far better at concocting such stories. Intellectualized tribalism is also more pernicious than raw tribalism because it is less self-aware. We all have, for instance, the raw tribalism of American nationalism, but because we are aware of this tribalism, we are far more likely to be rational about it and question our nation and its leaders. “Far more likely to be rational”? Do you remember bipartisan war hysteria after 9/11? I do. We haven’t deluded ourselves with the myth that everything our nation does somehow flows out of a righteous philosophy. Strange, I’d say that’s the standard bipartisan American view. The name of our “righteous philosophy” is “democracy.” 13. “The essentialist paradigm is making everyone stupid and evil.”  Thinking again on a continuum, what’s the marginal effect? One of the most common reactions to our rejection of the political spectrum, is the claim, “Well, it’s not perfect, but it’s useful.” People say this over and over, but never once to my knowledge has anyone provided any evidence for it. All of the scholarly evidence I’m aware of shows the exact opposite: those who think of politics in terms of a left-right spectrum are in a mental prison. They are far more dogmatic, hostile, closed-minded, and even unhappy. They can’t think as rationally or accurately as those who think outside the spectrum (Tetlock’s work on forecasting is pretty dispositive on this point). The spectrum is the opposite of useful. You’re equivocating on “useful.” When researchers say that the left-right spectrum is “useful,” they don’t mean that it helps fix social problems. Indeed, even the most fanatical left- and right-wing ideologues almost never maintain that the spectrum helps fix anything. Instead, they maintain that their side of the spectrum fixes the problems caused by the other side of the spectrum! When researchers claim that the spectrum is useful, what they mean rather is that using the spectrum helps us to understand political identity and political conflict. Which it totally does. No one has provided any evidence for this?! Every regression that shows that ideology predicts voting, issue views, or intermarriage is evidence. Want more? Read a few of Hanania’s brilliant essays on the intellectual and social anatomy of left versus right. And so while we’re on the subject, I would ask you, Bryan: why do you continue to use the political spectrum when it is so obviously detrimental to the cause of freedom that you and I believe in? I use the spectrum because it helps me understand the political world as it really is. Yes, I would like to believe that everyone and everything good is on “my side” and everyone everything bad is on the “other side.” But when I look and listen to other people in my political culture, that seems transparently self-serving. By telling us that Bryan Caplan is essentially like Adolf Hitler because both of you are part of “the right,” aren’t you playing into the hands of statist authoritarians? You can say that essentialism is 15% true without claiming that every leftist is “essentially like Stalin” or every rightist is “essentially like Hitler.” Personally, I claim neither of these things. Denigrating freedom by conceptually tying it to its opposite (fascism) seems rhetorically destructive to the cause of liberty. I agree, so I don’t. Even so, when fascists and communists fight for control of a country, I predict that libertarians will usually deem the fascists to be the lesser evil. Is that partly social? Of course. Is it 100% social? I think not. The market economy has been perhaps the greatest force for social justice in the history of the world, and yet “social justice warriors” reject markets because the political spectrum tells them that favoring markets is somehow “far right” and therefore “fascist.” Why tarnish freedom with this false guilt by association? This might explain why a few SJWs reject markets. Normally, however, the causation goes the other way. The left is anti-market. The fanatical left is fanatically anti-market. So if you breathe one good word about markets, the latter take the standard label for the worst kind of right-winger (“fascist” or “Nazi”) and stick it on you. A standard fanatical tactic. Denying the marginal explanatory value of the left-right spectrum won’t stop them from using this tactic. Shouldn’t we just give up the fiction that there is one issue in politics, and instead say, “free markets are good,” “racism is bad,” “war is bad,” “immigration is good” and those are distinct issues? They’re logically distinct and empirically connected. The empirical connection is modest, but on average, there’s a little logic to it. That’s not a fiction. Why give people the false impression that you are a racist, anti-immigrant warmonger because you believe in free markets? Do I give this impression? The essentialist theory isn’t just bad for society and individuals, it’s particularly bad for freedom so I’m surprised that so great a champion of freedom as yourself is so determined to hold onto it. Again, I hear an equivocation. I am determined to hold onto the left-right spectrum as a flawed but useful description of how politics actually works. At the same time, I would be delighted if these insipid ideologies themselves disappeared. What I won’t do is throw away a useful tool because I wish I lived in world where the tool didn’t work.";3436

Temporary Inflation Fees and Greedflation;https://betonit.substack.com/p/temporary-inflation-fees-and-greedflation;A couple weekends ago at the Original Pancake House, I encountered yet another strange form of inflation: the “Temporary Inflation Fee.” When you ask for a table, the concierge stand displays a list of seven rules. If you read to the end, you discover Rule #7, which proclaims the adoption of an unquantified Temporary Inflation Fee. When the check arrives, they start with the menu prices, then tack on another 3.6%. Someone else’s bill. Personally, I was more annoyed by the shrinkflation of the meal: The chocolate chips and whipped cream were considerably stingier than I remembered. Yet economically, it was the Temporary Inflation Fee that got my attention. Economists have lots of models with “menu costs,” and one obvious objection is “How high can menu costs be? You don’t actually have to print a new menu. If unexpected inflation hits, just announce a surcharge.” The TIF is the obvious objection come to life. A typical reply to the obvious objection is just that consumers consider surcharges “unfair.” Since I’ve never seen a TIF anywhere else, the simplest story is that the Original Pancake House is making a rare mistake. (Though they’re not entirely alone). Whatever extra money they earn from the TIF is worth less than the good will they’re losing by norm-breaking. Indeed, the customer who Yelped the receipt above opines: They have raised the prices and [are] about to raise them again. They have also put [a] Temporary Inflation fee on all checks. I don't know if the amount is a percentage or a flat fee. The sign is on the small plaque before you go to your table. They are not telling you about. They want you to find it... nope. This is robbery. Another story, however, is that after two years of high inflation, norms have broken down. Early in Covid, consumers would have been outraged by “price-gouging.” For a long time, businesses kept prices low even in the face of glaring shortages. After Biden’s second stimulus, though, the gap between the market price and the market-clearing price got so large that businesses started to bite the bullet: raise prices and alienate customers. As price hikes grew commonplace, they started to blend together. While consumers were annoyed in general, they lost the will to stay annoyed at any business in particular. Indeed, it quickly became hard to remember who had raised which prices by how much. A few economists aside, of course, almost no one acknowledges that inflation solved the problem of random shortages we’d endured since March of 2020. Remember: While pumping up Aggregate Demand during a boom is a bad idea, keeping prices steady in the face of runaway Aggregate Demand is an even worse idea. Will Temporary Inflation Fees spread? I suspect not. After a sharp disinflation (not to be confused with deflation!), most firms are no longer looking for a palatable way to raise prices. Equilibrium has returned. As price increases - nominal and real, forthright and sneaky - grow correspondingly rare, consumers become touchier about any remaining price hikes. Especially when you tack on a Temporary Inflation Fee that isn’t even on the menu. Does this sound like a populist “greedflation” story? Superficially, perhaps. My Big Picture, though, is that fairness norms mess up market performance until firms figure out a way to defuse them. Temporary Inflation Fees are a heavy-handed variant on what firms have been doing for the last two years. And compared to the alternative of perpetual shortages, we should be grateful.;597
Tenure Is a Total Scam;https://betonit.substack.com/p/tenure-is-a-total-scam;"I’m a tenured professor. In normal English, that means I have a dream job for life. Which is even more fantastic than it sounds. “Fantastic,” that is, for us tenured professors. From the viewpoint of the taxpayers and donors who subsidize us, however, this system is a total scam. An outrage. A travesty. Dear reader, I propose to give you a guided tour of the tenure system: How you get tenure, what tenure means in practice, and the laughable efforts of the professoriat to defend this affront to the word “job.” Some will call me a hypocrite for taking part in this system, but that’s part and parcel of being a whistleblower. If I wasn’t a tenured professor, who would take my critique seriously? What I tell you may seem crazy, but I’ve seen this system up close for thirty years. Even if every book I’ve ever written is wrong, I’m not wrong about this. Getting Tenure There are many kinds of professors, but the kind you want to be is a tenured professor. A tenured professor doesn’t just enjoy a good salary, wonderful working conditions, and extreme job security; he also never has to retire. How do you obtain this enviable employment package? Step one is to be a stellar undergraduate student of whatever subject you want to profess. Take the hardest classes, get top grades, and impress your professors enough to elicit strong letters of recommendation. Step two is to use your stellar undergraduate status to gain admission to a prestigious Ph.D. program with full funding. Full funding means (a) you pay no tuition, and (b) receive a modest stipend - maybe half of what you’d earn on a real job. Step three is to excel in your Ph.D. program. By this stage, grades barely matter, and officially finishing is fairly easy if you put in the required 4-8 years. (Completion time varies heavily by field). If grades barely matter, how do you excel? To “excel” in a Ph.D. program is to amass academic publications. Co-authorship with faculty is one route, but in many disciplines you can also publish solo. The endgame of the Ph.D. is writing a special book called a “dissertation.” If you’ve been strategic, though, this dissertation just rehashes all the stuff you’ve been publishing during your program. Step four, the most difficult by far, is to use your Ph.D., publications, dissertation, and connections to convince some academic department to hire you for a “tenure-track” position. This, and only this, gives you an opportunity to land your dream job for life. While you can definitely tilt the odds in your favor, the process is horrifyingly arbitrary. Some newly-minted Ph.D.s with great publications and great connections still confusingly fail. Others with no publications and no connections somehow land a position anyway. It’s psychedelic. Step five is to actually get tenure. You have roughly six years to publish well enough to convince the tenured professors at your department that you are worthy to join their mighty company. If you succeed, you are anointed with your dream job for life. Otherwise they fire you and you return to step four. Normally at a markedly inferior school. Bear in mind: For tenure-track professors at top-twenty schools, step five is hard. Their tenured professors jealously guard their status, so rejection is the default. However, as school ranking goes down, runaway nepotism swiftly supplants professorial pride. At schools ranked worse than fifty, acceptance is the default. Since low-ranked schools vastly outnumber high-ranked schools, you can often get tenure by publishing your dissertation - that special book you wrote to get your Ph.D. - with Some University Press, plus a couple of other token pieces in A Refereed Journal. If you’re not in a “book discipline,” just chop your dissertation into three or four articles and publish them in Some Other Refereed Journals. The Life of a Tenured Professor Holy moley, you’ve got your tenured professorship! What’s the full compensation package? Despite much whining, tenured professors are well-paid. Most reluctantly describe their income as “upper-middle class.” The poorest are still comfortably middle-class; the richest are easily “lower-upper class.” And that’s just base salary. Depending on their field, enterprising professors add on royalties, consulting income, speaking fees, and more. Still, it’s not the handsome salaries that make tenure a scam. It’s what tenured professors have to do to keep receiving those handsome salaries. Namely: Next to nothing! Officially, professors have three distinct sets of responsibilities: teaching, research, and service. Here, though, is the unofficial reality: Teaching. A typical tenured professor has a “2/2 teaching load.” That means that every year, you teach four distinct classes. Each of these classes normally has 2.5 hours of class time per week for 15 weeks. 4 * 15 * 2.5 hours=150 hours in the classroom per year. What about prep? You only have to do it the first time you teach a course, then recycle for the rest of your career. What about grading? You can delegate most that to your Teaching Assistant. (If your school doesn’t give you one, you can hire your own, cheap). Add it all up, and teaching is under 10% of the time commitment of a normal 2000-hour-per-year job. (40 hours per week * 50 weeks per year = 2000 hours per year). For less-fortunate faculty with 3/3 loads, teaching comes to just over 10% of a normal job. For the truly oppressed with 4/4, we’re talking 15%. Poor them! Research. To repeat: You must do research to get tenure. Research expectations range from herculean at top schools, to “Publish your dissertation and a couple more articles” at mediocre schools. Either way, once you have tenure, you keep your position even if you publish nothing at all. And if you do Google Scholar on random tenured professors, you’ll discover that about half barely publish post-tenure. Sure, weak researchers get modestly lower raises and dramatically fewer outside offers, but the career consequences end there. What makes low research productivity so shocking is that you can call practically anything “research.” There are endless crummy journals in need of content. Or you can just self-publish on Substack. (Say what you want about me, but I am self-aware). The system tells tenured professors, “Write about whatever you find interesting” - and about half of faculty yawn and write nothing. Scary! Service. Professors are also supposed to serve on a bunch of committees. Most departments largely excuse tenure-track assistant professors from serious burdens; after all, they’re trying to get tenure. Once you attain tenure, you’re supposed to start doing your part. This so-called “service” could consume your life… if you let it. However, if you officially do zero service, the consequences are slight. Maybe you won’t get promoted to “Full Professor.” Boo-hoo. And if you unofficially do no service by agreeing to serve while doing no work, the consequences are near-zero. I know older faculty who resigned because they disliked service. They even used the grammar of, “I had to do too much service.” When I probed, “Why didn’t you just say, ‘I’m too old and tired to serve on any more committees’?” they only shrugged. One responded: “That’s not how I was brought up.” None even claimed they would face any serious consequence of stonewalling. To recap: Tenured professors get good salaries to do about 10% of a real job. 15% tops. All their other responsibilities are, for practical purposes, optional. Sounds good, right? But this glosses over two further astronomically valuable benefits. Namely: Firing a tenured professor is almost impossible. Unlike research and service, teaching is mandatory. As long as you show up for your classes and go through the motions, though, you’ve “fulfilled your teaching responsibilities” - and you’re virtually immune to termination. Don’t you have to at least show up at your office and pretend to work? No no no! Plenty of faculty visit their offices weekly, monthly, seasonally, annually, or once in a blue moon. Officially, you’re supposed to have office hours, but you can Zoom those if students yearn to talk to you. Which few do. What else will get your tenure revoked? If you’re convicted of a felony against student or staff, that will usually suffice. Game theorist Rafael Robb lost tenure for murdering his wife. Sleeping with students? Maybe, but most schools will just pay you a bag of money to leave quietly. For the time being, tenure remains stronger than wokeness itself. While I occasionally hear that a professor had tenure revoked for anti-woke heresy, the true story is almost invariably, “The heretic felt hated and the administration felt ashamed. So they paid the heretic a bag of cash to leave.” UPenn law professor Amy Wax is the only exception I know of - and her heresy case is still in process. I agree that the real reason Princeton fired Josh Katz was heresy, but if he hadn’t slept with a student, he too would have been safe. No one can make you retire. Seriously. As long as you can teach 150 hours a year, you get to keep your job. It doesn’t matter if you’re 150 years old. As the American Association of University Professors states: Until 1982, colleges and universities could mandate the retirement of faculty at age sixty-five, and, until 1994, they could mandate retirement at age seventy. Since 1994, however, federal legislation has prevent­ed academic institutions from setting any manda­tory retirement age. If you read further, you’ll head-scratchingly discover that the same rules officially apply to most non-academic jobs, too. Back in 1993, the Chronicle of Higher Education explained: Higher education has for years enjoyed a special exemption under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, which bars most employers from enforcing mandatory retirement. After the exemption expires on December 31, tenured professors will be free to choose whether to continue working at 70. A normal job, however, has a simple way to handle this problem. An 80-year-old won’t retire? Give him enough work to strain a 40-year-old. Before long, he’ll say “I’m too old to keep doing this.” If he’s really stubborn, you can easily fire him for cause. In contrast, since academia barely asks tenured professors to do any work at any age, you can “work” till you drop. The one solution that is available to academic employers, as usual, is to offer you a big bag of money to retire voluntarily. And if you’re wise, you’ll scoff, “Three years’ salary to retire? I’m gonna live more than three years, sonny!” Defending Dysfunction Non-academics usually assume that professors’ main job is teaching students. When they hear how little professors actually teach - and how much they receive in exchange - their minds explode. Indeed, non-academics almost invariably go into denial: “It can’t really work like that!” My Dad still only half-believes what I tell him about my job. If and when the disbelief ends, anyone with a normal job instantly realizes that tenure is a recipe for terrible job performance. Sure, people will struggle to get tenure: “Publish or perish.” Once they do, however, they’ll rest on their laurels until their teeth fall out. Cynics will add: “Even if this is a great system for encouraging research, how much of this ‘research’ is worth doing?” If they pursue these doubts, most non-academics will look at STEM research and say, “Maybe it’s really important, I just can’t tell.” Virtually all other research, however, looks like a cultish waste of time to all unbelievers. Still, the economically literate will be most astounded by the sheer arbitrariness of the system. Due to severely nepotistic tenure votes outside of top departments, the key cutoff is not getting tenure. The key cutoff is obtaining a tenure-track job. 80% of faculty who get tenure at mediocre schools could easily be replaced with professors who are plainly better in every way, but who weren’t lucky enough to land a tenure-track job straight out of grad school. Other than flatly declaring, “Well, the system is great for me,” how could anyone defend actually-existing tenure? The classic story is that tenure protects dissenters. This argument is true as far as it goes. If I didn’t have tenure, I wouldn’t be blowing the whistle on tenure. The flaw with the argument is that academic dissenters remain ultra-rare. Far too rare to justify the enormous downsides of the tenure system. And from a bird’s-eye view, the full effect of tenure on dissent is mixed at best. Remember: To get tenure, a dissenter normally has to spend a decade and a half impersonating a normal academic. If you start the process as a non-conformist, the system almost always either weeds you out or wins you over. By the time you get tenure, a creepy chorus of “One of us! One of us!” is in order. A few economists have argued that tenure makes sense because it reduces the incentive of “over-the-hill” researchers to treat rising stars as a career threat. You don’t want to hire anyone good enough to replace you, right? However, this worry applies to virtually any high-skilled job, and virtually no other high-skilled job handles this worry with anything remotely like tenure. Most defenders soon retreat to a Panglossian, “If tenure was really a bad idea, it wouldn’t be so prevalent.” But this neglects a simple alternative two-part explanation: Universities combine perverse incentives with feeble selection pressure, allowing dysfunction to durably thrive. Perverse incentives. Colleges and universities are almost always non-profits, and non-profits work poorly. If a university president discovers a way to save piles of money while upsetting the faculty, he has a strong incentive to bury his discovery and preserve the status quo. After all, he’ll personally pocket none of the cost savings, yet endure all of the grief. Feeble selection pressure. Colleges and universities are heavily subsidized by taxpayers and donors. They’re not like normal businesses that go bankrupt if they stagnate. Not even close. As a result, their leadership can safely remain dysfunctional even in the long-run. Not perfectly safe, for there are a few tiny exceptions. But safe enough. What is to be done? As I explain in my The Case Against Education (published by Princeton University Press, ha!), the fundamental remedy for everything wrong with our education system is austerity. Cut the subsidies for this grotesque scam, and it will drastically shrink. Conceivably it will even… reform. Though I stand by the glory of austerity, over last few years Chris Rufo and Corey DeAngelis have demonstrated that pugnacious reformers in red states can awaken public resentment against our educational status quo. Chris and Corey, if you’re reading this, I hope that my realistic portrait of academic tenure is lurid enough for you to work some more of your patented policy magic. The oppression of taxpayers and the deception of donors need to end. If the result is that I lose my dream job for life, so be it.";2590
*The Myth of Left and Right*: Verlan Lewis Responds;https://betonit.substack.com/p/the-myth-of-left-and-right-verlan;"Now Verlan Lewis reacts to last week’s interview on The Myth of Left and Right. I think Hyrum did an excellent job responding to the subsequent questions posted, so I will just pick up a few strands from the conversation that I feel like we did not adequately articulate or emphasize. A common misconception about our argument, that we should have done a better job in the book clarifying, is the perception that we do not believe that humans are able to engage in coherent abstract political thought that ties together multiple political issue positions. This is not our view. We do believe people are capable of thinking about politics philosophically. As you say in the interview, some people come to their issue positions based on belief systems like Aristotelianism, Christianity, and libertarianism. Our argument is simply that these various belief systems have nothing to do with “left” or “right.” The terms “left” and “right” have become so entwined with alternating party control of various governments over the centuries that the terms have become meaningless from a philosophical standpoint. They give us social, but not ideological, information. Another common misperception is that we do not believe that any issue positions have any logical connection to each other. This is also not our view. We do believe that issue positions can have a logical connection. There are some issue positions that do naturally correlate by virtue of nature and logic. For example, being in favor of free markets domestically is logically connected to being in favor of free trade internationally. It makes sense, on that micro level, that those positions would go together. However, that has nothing to do with “left” and “right” because those are tribes rather than philosophies: the issue positions and values of those two tribes are constantly evolving. As you well know, sometimes “liberals” have been more likely to take those two positions simultaneously (mid-19th century England) and sometimes “conservatives” have been more likely to take those two positions simultaneously (mid-20th century America). Sometimes “progressives” have held one position and not the other, and sometimes “conservatives” have held one position and not the other. The fact that some issue positions, absent social conformism, will naturally correlate by virtue of logic may be true, but that has nothing to do with a “left-right” uni-dimensional spectrum where these hundreds of naturally correlating issue clusters—logical on their own on a micro level—get crammed together on either side of  a uni-dimensional “left-right” spectrum. A great question you raised in our interview (paraphrasing) was: “Isn’t the stark dichotomy you present between the essentialist theory and the social theory as false as the stark left-right dichotomy you criticize in the book”? In other words, why does it have to be all or nothing? Can’t the social theory usefully explain, for example, 85% of the political behavior we observe and the essentialist theory usefully explain a mere 15% of the political behavior we observe? I don’t think the essentialist theory of left and right explains 15% of the political phenomena we observe in the world for the same reason that I do not think the geocentric theory of the universe explains 15% of the astronomical phenomena we observe. Yes, the geocentric theory can purport to give an explanation of the phenomena we observe each day (including why the sun rises in the east horizon and sets in the west horizon), but that does not make the geocentric theory 15% true. It is 100% false. The fact is that the earth revolves around the sun and the fact is that there is more than one issue in politics. It is not 15% true that the sun revolves around the earth or 15% true that there is only one, overarching, essential issue in politics. In the interview, you pointed to some amount of issue position correlation as evidence that the essentialist theory is partly (although not fully) true. This is a common response we hear: When we point out that there is no essence to “left” or “right,” people often respond that there must be some essence because survey data shows correlation between people identifying with Tribe Left or Tribe Right and certain issue positions (e.g., someone who identifies as “liberal” today is, on the margins, more likely to be more in favor of abortion rights, less in favor of capital punishment, more in favor of income taxes, less in favor of import taxes, more in favor of regulating big oil, less in favor of regulating big tech, more in favor of military intervention in Eastern Europe, less in favor of military intervention in the Middle East, more in favor of restrictions on gun sales, less in favor of restrictions on marijuana sales, more in favor of the free movement of people and goods across international borders, less in favor of the free movement of goods across state borders, and more concerned about the character of elected officials than someone who identifies as “conservative”). The person who points this out is not saying that these issue positions are 100% correlated, but they are saying that there is a greater chance that someone identifying as a “liberal” will hold one or more of these issue positions than someone identifying as a “conservative.” We recognize that is true, but the question is why? Many people assume that if the survey data shows x amount of correlation between these issue positions (above no correlation at all), then the essentialist theory must be x% true. We disagree that this x amount of correlation has to be the result of an essence that ties issue positions together. We point out that this correlation appears to be entirely the result of socialization (after all, the correlation does not exist among those who do not know what currently flies under the banners of “left” and “right”). The evidence we discovered in testing these two different theories points to the social theory as far better at explaining the correlations we see than the essentialist theory (in the same way that the Copernican theory is a far better explanation for why we see the sun rise and set each day than the geocentric theory). Your time-traveling conventions thought experiment goes from the realm of current correlations to historical correlations. I liked that because it helped us think through the correlation vs. causation difficulty even more. You say that if we gathered into two camps everyone who has ever identified as “left-wing,” and put them in a convention, and everyone who has ever identified as “right-wing,” and put them in a convention, then we would see a lot of diversity within each convention but, on the margins, some views that are more common to the “left-wing” convention than the “right-wing” convention. You conclude that this must be the result of an essence binding together these core issue positions. But remember, correlation is not causation. It seems to me that historical contingency is a better explanation of any correlations you might discover (if you even could discover them). For example, you posited that Tribe Left is defined by an “anti-market” essence and pointed to the supposed agreement we would find in the time-traveling “left-wing” convention around the position of being anti-market. I pointed out that Team Left was first created in Paris in the 1780s by people who were opposed to monarchy and who were pro-market. You responded that it took a few years, but eventually, the French sorted themselves out and the people who were anti-monarchy finally came around to their natural position of being anti-market. But why should we think that nature binds those two issue positions together? Isn’t it more likely that the left-hand side of the National Assembly went from being pro-market to anti-market not because nature dictates that people who are against monarchy are also against markets but because those people happened to take control of the government and became pro-state? I think the logical reasoning of Bryan Caplan and Robin Hanson are good examples of the fact that being anti-monarchy is not naturally tied by logic to being anti-market. As far as I know, you are both anti-monarchy and pro-market (like the French Left of the 1780s). I don’t believe the original French Left had to become anti-market because that was their “essence.” I think they became anti-market because they were a political group that took control of the state and wanted to start regulating markets to their own advantage. This seems to be entirely explained by historical contingency (those in control of government want the government to be powerful) rather than some ""left-wing” essence forcing together the issue positions of democracy and anti-market. Once again, I found the discussion thought-provoking and interesting, and I hope to keep the conversation going.";1501
Hess Contra Harrison Bergeron;https://betonit.substack.com/p/hess-builds-a-better-lottery;AEI’s Rick Hess recently wrote a piece advocating college admission by lottery. Though I’m deeply unsympathetic to this idea in general, Hess’ version of lottery admissions is, paradoxically, highly meritocratic. I explain why in this brief reaction essay for National Review - and Hess responds. Here’s a slightly longer version of my reaction essay, reprinted with permission. Harvard philosopher Michael Sandel has been pushing an elite college admissions lottery for years. Sandel: Harvard and Stanford get something like 50,000 applicants for 2,000 places. Most of them are well-qualified. Cull out those who are not well-qualified, and among the rest, the 20,000 or 25,000, whatever the number is, admit by lottery. Frankly, this is a crazy idea. The whole reason why students want to attend ultra-selective colleges is that they are ultra-selective! If top schools start randomly admitting kids from the top half of the applicant pool, they instantly shred the main reason to attend. At first glance, Rick Hess seems to be repeating Sandel’s crazy proposal. But if you read closely, there is a crucial difference. Hess lets schools set their bars as high as they want: If colleges wish to be eligible for publicly funded grants, contracts, or aid, they should be required to establish transparent admissions qualifications and then randomly select from among those who qualify. For particular programs that require particular knowledge or skills (think engineering or dance), institutions should be free to set a higher bar, require auditions, or institute similarly open and competitive measures. In principle, this allows schools to make their admission standards so stringent that they need no lottery: If you have a hundred slots, admit the hundred best in the world. Given these constraints, top schools will very likely protect their status by adopting strict cutoffs. The upshot: While Sandel is explicitly trying to end what he calls “the tyranny of merit,” Hess is proposing more meritocracy than ever. Is this a good idea? I say “Do it.” Nobel prizes should go to the best scientists, Olympic medals to the best athletes, billions to the best entrepreneurs, and elite college slots to the best students. Meritocracy is the fairest and the most socially functional ideal. While people should be free to be unfair and dysfunctional, Hess is right: If you want to re-enact Kurt Vonnegut’s “Harrison Bergeron,” government shouldn’t let you do it at taxpayer expense.;408
*The Myth of Left and Right*: Hyrum Lewis Responds;https://betonit.substack.com/p/the-myth-of-left-and-right-hyrum;"Both of the Lewis brothers have kindly written detailed followups to last week’s interview on their prize-winning iconoclastic book, The Myth of Left and Right. Here’s Hyrum. Dear Bryan, See my responses to your questions below. Perhaps Verlan will find those adequate, but if he has anything to add I’d love to hear it. Thanks again for your intellectual humility and good faith in giving us the chance to air our views, even though we are not in complete agreement. I address some of our disagreements here and look forward to your responses to my responses. All the best, Hyrum 1. What are the three best bodies of evidence in your favor? Thanks for the softball, Bryan :-) Yes, so most people believe in what we call the “essentialist theory of ideology,” which says that politics is about one big thing (e.g., progress vs. preservation) and therefore the political spectrum is useful to measure that one big thing. We, by contrast argue that politics is about many disparate, unrelated things and that the political spectrum is therefore misleading. We’ve found that these three lines of evidence (each backed by numerous studies) best militate in favor of our position: Historical: Even a cursory look at history shows that what is considered left and right is always changing. Pro-market used to be considered “liberal” (e.g., Jefferson and Jackson) and then later was considered “conservative” (e.g., Taft and Reagan). Militarism used to be considered “liberal” (Wilson, Roosevelt, Truman—remember all those “right-wing” isolationists who didn’t want to get involved in WWII?) and then later it was considered “conservative” (Reagan and W. Bush). If some positions were essentially “conservative” then we would see conservatives embracing those positions across time and space. We don’t, indicating that there are no essentially conservative (or liberal) positions. Laboratory: Scholars have shown that they can get ideologues to switch positions simply by priming them with social cues. So if experimenters tell self-described “conservatives” that Donald Trump supports the minimum wage, those conservatives also support the minimum wage; if they tell self-described “conservatives” that Trump opposes the minimum wage, those conservatives also oppose the minimum wage (and the more conservative someone is, the more likely they are to follow the social cues). If support for the minimum wage grew out of an essential conservative philosophy or disposition, conservatives would draw their positions from that essence. They don’t. They draw it from their social group. Survey: When we survey Americans about their individual political positions, we find no correlation between issues considered liberal (such as belief in abortion rights and belief in redistribution of wealth) except among those most socialized into believing in the political spectrum. If abortion rights and redistribution went together naturally because they both shared a left-wing essence, we would expect to see people holding those views in a package, regardless of their exposure to the left-right paradigm. 6.a. Aren’t you holding essentialists to too high of a bar?  I don’t think so because we are holding them to the bar of falsification, which is what separates rationality from dogmatism and science from religion. All scholarly theories must be, in principle, falsifiable and yet the essentialist position has been, in our view, soundly falsified. So, let’s go back to your claim that leftists are essentially anti-market: What if the next president of the United States (with the help of a congress from his own party) was the most anti-market president in a generation—radically increasing spending, signing new economic regulations, running up debt, and significantly decreasing America’s “economic freedom” score—and yet the left hated him and the right loved him. Would this falsify your view that the left is essentially anti-market? If “anti-market” defined the left, then wouldn’t your theory predict that the left would love this extremely anti-market president? If so, then the presidency of George W. Bush has already falsified your claim. Now, the common retort to this is, “Well, there are many other issues in politics besides just markets and the left hated Bush because of his stances on the Iraq war, abortion, gay marriage, and other social and foreign policy issues.” To which we say: “Exactly!” There are many, many other issues in politics besides markets (e.g., immigration, abortion, diplomacy, war, affirmative action, gay marriage, capital punishment, gun control, drug control, etc.), so why use a unidimensional spectrum that presumes there is only one (pro vs. anti-market)? We don’t use a unidimensional spectrum in any other complex realm of life for good reason (there is no single “business spectrum,” “medical spectrum,” “recreation spectrum,” etc.), so why do we use one in politics? We shouldn’t. 6.b. At any given time, leftist and rightist thinkers disagree, so there’s got to be some room for indeterminacy, right? Yes, all categories have indeterminacy at the margins. For instance, we could show that there is indeterminacy in the category “chair”—which we might define as “a human-made device for human sitting”—by pointing to marginal examples, such as dollhouse chairs or stumps around a campfire. But the left-right categories are not indeterminate at the margins, they are incoherent at their core. To show why, let’s go back once again to your “anti-market” essence: Adolf Hitler was not a marginal figure to the right; he’s considered the quintessential right winger—the purest, most perfect embodiment of the right-wing essence taken to its logical conclusion. And yet he was a proud socialist who believed in government nationalization of private industry and vast redistributions of wealth. Hitler was, by any measure extremely anti-market. So, according to the “anti-market” essence, Hitler should be on the “far left” (his anti-market views were even more extreme than the most radical Democrats today). The same is true of Tojo, Mussolini, and many other quintessential “far right” figures of the past century. Donald Trump is not a marginal figure to the right; he’s considered the quintessential American right winger—a “far right” ideologue who captured the Republican Party and drove it to its extreme right wing—and yet Trump is far more anti-market than was Bill Clinton. So why does the left despise Trump and praise Clinton? When Trump and Bush moved the Republican Party in a more anti-market direction, we were told that they had both moved the party “to the right.” It seems to me that if your “anti-market” essentialist claim were correct, the consensus would be that Bush and Trump had moved the party “to the left.” Of course, the falsifying evidence doesn’t stop there. Here’s more: The War on Terror: if the left is essentially “anti-market,” why did the left (more than the right) tend to oppose the War on Terror and national security state more generally even though its expenditures and government controls reduced economic freedom? The essentialist theory has no answer, the social theory does. Immigration: if the left is essentially “anti-market,” why does the left currently want more of a “market” in laborers from foreign countries? The essentialist theory has no answer, the social theory does. Drugs, Gambling, and Prostitution: if the left is essentially “anti-market,” why is the left currently more in favor of free markets when it comes to drugs, prostitution, and gambling? The right says “drugs kill people so we have to regulate the sale of drugs”; the left says, “guns kill people so we have to regulate the sale of guns”—why the inconsistency? The essentialist theory has no answer, the social theory does. Tech companies: if the left is essentially “anti-market,” why was Trump’s proposal to control the “liberal” private-sector tech companies considered “right wing”? The essentialist theory has no answer, the social theory does. Mitt Romney: if the left is essentially “anti-market,” why is Mitt Romney considered to be more moderate (and therefore further to “the left” on the political spectrum) than Donald Trump even though he is far more pro-market? The essentialist theory has no answer, the social theory does. It seems pretty clear to me that both sides are anti-market depending on the context and what certain market actors are doing relative to the tribes. All of the above is, in my view, more than sufficient to falsify the claim that the left is defined by an “anti-market” disposition. 11. You seem willing to accept sub-level essentialism, like “support for economic freedom” or “hawkish foreign policy.”  But don’t all of your arguments about the logical independence (or “granularity”) of issues apply here, too? Yes, but the difference is that some categories are accurate and useful and others are inaccurate and harmful. It was correct for doctors in the mid 19th century to accept sub-level essentialism when it came to categories such as “fever” or “vomiting” or “hemorrhage,” but not the high-level essentialism of the four humors theory. It’s only when they gave up the high-level essentialism (with all of the bleeding and purging it entailed) that doctors finally began to save more lives than they took. We need to give up the high-level essentialism of the political spectrum in the same way and for many of the same reasons. The sports analogy can further provide an answer to your question: treating the sub-level category of “speed” as essential is useful for evaluating individual basketball players, but not for explaining the bundle of players we cheer for. Pretending that all Los Angeles Laker players share the essence of “speed” and deluding ourselves that we cheer for the Lakers because we cheer for speedy players would not be useful. Nor would it be true: we can falsify the “speed” essence by pointing to slow (non-marginal) Lakers such as Shaquille O’Neal, Kurt Rambis, and Kareem Abdul Jabbar, just as we can falsify the “left = anti-market” essence by pointing to anti-market (non-marginal) rightists such as Hitler, Tojo, Mussolini, W. Bush, and Trump. When it comes to sports, we have all recognized the obvious fact that we cheer for certain players not because of some essence they share, but because they are associated with our team (the Lakers), so why can’t we do the same in politics and recognize that we cheer for certain positions not because of some “essence” they share, but because they are associated with our team (the Left or Right). 12. Quote from p.79 on raw tribalism versus intellectualized tribalism.  True? Perhaps you could be a bit more specific, but I think our main point is that the highly intellectual are more likely to be tribal when it comes to politics because the essentialist myth is upheld by ex post storytelling and intellectuals are far better at concocting such stories. Intellectualized tribalism is also more pernicious than raw tribalism because it is less self-aware. We all have, for instance, the raw tribalism of American nationalism, but because we are aware of this tribalism, we are far more likely to be rational about it and question our nation and its leaders. We haven’t deluded ourselves with the myth that everything our nation does somehow flows out of a righteous philosophy. That’s not the case when it comes to left-wing ideology where intellectualized tribalists have convinced themselves that everything left-wing is righteous because it all flows out of the righteous philosophy of “progress” or “social justice.” 13. “The essentialist paradigm is making everyone stupid and evil.”  Thinking again on a continuum, what’s the marginal effect? One of the most common reactions to our rejection of the political spectrum, is the claim, “Well, it’s not perfect, but it’s useful.” People say this over and over, but never once to my knowledge has anyone provided any evidence for it. All of the scholarly evidence I’m aware of shows the exact opposite: those who think of politics in terms of a left-right spectrum are in a mental prison. They are far more dogmatic, hostile, closed-minded, and even unhappy. They can’t think as rationally or accurately as those who think outside the spectrum (Tetlock’s work on forecasting is pretty dispositive on this point). The spectrum is the opposite of useful. It’s not just that there’s no scholarly evidence for the usefulness of the spectrum, I’m not even aware of any anecdotal evidence. In fact, I can’t even imagine any anecdotal evidence that would back it up. None of us, for instance, would ever expect to hear someone say, “My uncle used to be a cranky, wild-eyed nutcase, who was irrational, hostile, conspiratorial, and angry when it came to politics, but then he discovered the political spectrum, embraced a right-wing identity, and he’s been calm, thoughtful, and charitable ever since.” The political spectrum is neither correct nor useful. It doesn’t pass the epistemic or pragmatic tests that should justify all models, especially political ones. So, to answer your question: the marginal effect of the essentialist theory that underlies the political spectrum is decidedly negative. All of the scholarly and anecdotal evidence I’m aware of show that it creates irrationality and unjustified hostility among those who use it. And so while we’re on the subject, I would ask you, Bryan: why do you continue to use the political spectrum when it is so obviously detrimental to the cause of freedom that you and I believe in? By telling us that Bryan Caplan is essentially like Adolf Hitler because both of you are part of “the right,” aren’t you playing into the hands of statist authoritarians? Denigrating freedom by conceptually tying it to its opposite (fascism) seems rhetorically destructive to the cause of liberty. The market economy has been perhaps the greatest force for social justice in the history of the world, and yet “social justice warriors” reject markets because the political spectrum tells them that favoring markets is somehow “far right” and therefore “fascist.” Why tarnish freedom with this false guilt by association? Shouldn’t we just give up the fiction that there is one issue in politics, and instead say, “free markets are good,” “racism is bad,” “war is bad,” “immigration is good” and those are distinct issues? Why give people the false impression that you are a racist, anti-immigrant warmonger because you believe in free markets? The essentialist theory isn’t just bad for society and individuals, it’s particularly bad for freedom so I’m surprised that so great a champion of freedom as yourself is so determined to hold onto it. Thanks for giving us this chance to respond to your questions. Hyrum";2485
Doxastic Voluntarism;https://betonit.substack.com/p/doxastic-voluntarism;"Socrates infamously argued that no one willfully does evil: “No one does wrong voluntarily, but that all do wrong against their will.” Why infamous? Because almost everyone knows via introspection that they have personally taken actions they knew to be morally wrong when they took them. While few accept the Socratic position, many smart people embrace a toned-down version thereof. While they grant that humans willfully take actions they know to be wrong, they deny that humans willfully accept beliefs they know to be false. The standard argument, once again, appeals to introspection: “Try to believe you’re a pink elephant. Try as hard as you like. You can’t do it, can you?” The inference: Doxastic voluntarism - the view that humans can choose their beliefs - is false. Actions may be chosen; beliefs, in contrast, are forced upon us. Let’s start by slowing down, because even on purely introspective grounds, doxastic voluntarism is more plausible than it initially seems. Suppose you belong to a fanatical religious cult. You’re in the habit of embracing every dogma pronounced by the cult leader without question. One day, the cult leader points to you and declares, “You’re a pink elephant!” Is it really so crazy to imagine that your reaction to this will be to sincerely declare, “I am a pink elephant”? Even if you respond with severe cognitive dissonance - “The cult leader is never wrong, but I sure don’t look like a pink elephant in the mirror!” - the cult leader’s pronouncement plainly boosts your subjective probability of being a pink elephant. In any case, suppose the Pink Elephant Argument is certainly true as far as it goes. It still doesn’t show that we are incapable of accepting any belief we know to be false. The Pink Elephant Argument only shows that we are incapable of accepting some beliefs we know to be false. “You can’t cut off your own arm” doesn’t prove you can’t take any action you know to be wrong. Similarly, “You can’t believe you’re a pink elephant” doesn’t prove you can’t accept any belief you know to be false. You could object, “The Pink Elephant Argument is designed to illustrate, not ‘prove,’ a universal law. If you disagree, name a single counter-example.” Yet this challenge is not hard to meet. Think about any time you allowed your emotions to corrupt your judgment. Your emotional attachment to your religion. Your emotional attachment to your ideology. Your emotional attachment to your social network. Your emotional attachment to your own sense of infallibility. My most egregious offense along these lines, I confess, was continuing to accept Ayn Rand’s Objectivist ethics despite its many logical flaws because I thought nihilism was the only alternative and nihilism horrified me. You could demur, “Emotions can lead you to say things you know to be false, but not to sincerely believe them.” When people say crazy things, I agree that insincerity is part of the story. But the whole story? That contradicts my own introspection - and I’m almost certainly not alone. Think about the millions of earnest ideologues who angrily embrace whatever their side’s thought leaders declare. They can’t all be faking. Still unconvinced? Then let me retreat to a slightly more moderate version of doxastic voluntarism. Even if you can’t directly accept beliefs you know to be false, you can readily take actions that indirectly but sharply raise your probability of accepting beliefs you know to be false. For example, you can… Refuse to scrutinize positions you find emotionally appealing, while heavily scrutinizing positions to find emotionally repulsive. Trust people who tell you things you find emotionally appealing, while distrusting people who tell you things you find emotionally repulsive. Socialize heavily with people who hold beliefs you find emotionally appealing, while shunning people who hold beliefs you find emotionally repulsive. Granted, taking these actions does not guarantee you will accept beliefs you know to be false. Yet in the fullness of time, they drastically raise the probability that you will in the future accept beliefs you know to be false today. Picture, for example, a person who is well-aware of the absurd biases of the mainstream media. If this person starts regularly watching mainstream media, they will still predictably come to accept many mainstream distortions as fact. Indeed, to do otherwise requires an iron will. At this point, you may reply, “Fine, some version of doxastic voluntarism wins. But what difference does it make?” Here’s the difference it makes: Moral philosophers routinely remind us that “Ought implies can.” If we can’t choose our beliefs, it is nonsensical to blame people for holding even the most absurd beliefs. If we can choose our beliefs, in contrast, we can at least reasonably wonder, “Should we blame some people for holding the beliefs that they do?”* Starting with… yourself. Morality begins at home. Once you accept any version of doxastic voluntarism, the immediate question is, “Have I chosen my beliefs scrupulously?” Which calls for a thorough self-audit. Do you play favorites with your beliefs, subjecting favored conclusions to light review while holding disfavored conclusions to heavy review? Do you apply circular standards (“He’s credible because he tells me what I want to believe”) when you decide who to trust? Do you surround yourself with yes-men and yes-women? Who’s your closest friend who keeps telling you “You’re wrong”? Does every word of Social Desirability Bias make you cringe? Once you’ve got your own house in order, the next step is to monitor the doxastic virtue of those you know personally. News flash: Intellectual honesty varies widely! If you value your virtue, you will search for friends whose virtue is worthy of emulation. Zooming out further, you’ll notice that much of humanity forms deep beliefs with severe negligence. Instead of controlling their emotions, they exalt them. I call such people “fanatics” - and blame them for most of the pure evil in the world. While there is a tiny chance a fanatic ends up with reasonable conclusions, this is phenomenally unlikely. Instead, fanatics’ intellectual negligence normally leads them, as Voltaire might put it, to “believe absurdities” and - if they ever their clutches on the wheel of power - to “commit atrocities.” Strange as it seems, my commitment to doxastic voluntarism is probably the main reason why I’m much harsher on the critical theorists than Chris Rufo himself. He repeatedly makes remarks like, “The critical theorists couldn’t help but believe…” I maintain the critical theorists totally could have helped believing their Orwellian nonsense. So could Lenin, Hitler, Mao, and the Ayatollah Khomeini. While they were all sincere fanatics, their fanaticism was a supremely blameworthy choice. * Admittedly, a strict consequentialist might embrace a “noble lie” variant of cancel culture, ostracizing people not because their beliefs are truly blameworthy but because people respond to negative incentives. HT: Martin Cox of the John Locke Institute, who recently reminded me of the issue at his Georgetown summer school.";1183
Talking Feminism in Poland;https://betonit.substack.com/p/talking-feminism-in-poland;This June, Instytut Wiedzy o Rodzinie i Społeczeństwie (“Institute of Family and Society Knowledge”), Poland’s main natalist organization, interviewed me for their girls’ channel*. Katarzynę Lachman talks to me about feminism, finding a good man, AI, the end of the world, “women’s tears,” and much more. If she doesn’t become a major media figure in Poland and beyond I’ll be surprised. Katarzynę’s got the whole package of brains, knowledge, personality, curiosity, and star power. Plus she’s already an international fencing champion. If she asks to interview you, say Yes. * The channel is called Piekna Dziewczyna, which translates to “Beautiful Girl,” with the subtitle “A place where girls pull themselves up.”;116
My Simplistic Theory of Left and Right: The Talk;https://betonit.substack.com/p/my-simplistic-theory-of-left-and;[Reminder: I’m running my first Ask Me Anything for paid subscribers tomorrow at 4 PM ET. With all new AV equipment. Upgrade if you want to participate.] Back in 2015, I found myself deeply dissatisfied with all of the other theories of left and right. Survive/thrive theory is especially overrated. So I modestly proposed my own: the Simplistic Theory of Left and Right. When I look at the top-two rival global ideologies, I, like the Lewis brothers, mostly see an incoherent mess driven by tribalism. Unlike the Lewis brothers, however, I also see two durable if insipid intellectual cores: The left is anti-market. The right is anti-left. I’ve been pushing my Simplistic Theory for almost a decade. Multiple supportive essays get considerable space in my recent Voters As Mad Scientists. Yet only recently did I publicly present by first talk on the subject to the Sarasota Economics Club. Here’s the video of the full talk, followed by Q&A. Moderated by the Reason Foundation’s Adrian Moore. Enjoy!;175
The Myth of Left and Right;https://betonit.substack.com/p/the-myth-of-left-and-right;"[Here are Robin Hanson’s thoughts on the same book and interview.] About a year ago, historian Hyrum Lewis emailed me about his new book, The Myth of Left and Right: How the Political Spectrum Misleads and Harms America, co-authored with his brother, political scientist Verlan Lewis. I received a copy, placed it on a stack of unread books, and forgot about it. Until, fortuitously, I bumped into Hyrum at the Memphis Airport after FreedomFest 2023. Hyrum and his brother had just received the Leonard E. “Read This Book Award.” Long story short: Hyrum and I had a thrilling hour-long pre-flight conversation about our views on the nature of ideology. So great, in fact, that I grabbed The Myth of Left and Right off my stack of unread books as soon as I came home. I devoured it, then passed it onto Robin Hanson, who predictably became a fan in his own right. The thesis of The Myth of Left and Right: Despite much pretense, neither “left” nor “right” are remotely coherent philosophies. There is no foundational leftist premise from which leftist conclusions flow, nor is there any foundational rightist premise from which rightist conclusions flow. Ideologies don’t just change mightily over the long-run; they change sharply even from one election to another. For intellectually irrelevant reasons. The Lewis brothers do not defend the moderate position that the two main ideologies fail to make perfect sense. In both print and in-person, they affirm that the two main ideologies make no sense at all. Our political polarization rests on a giant collective delusion. Provocative! So I decided to I organize a 2x2 interview where Robin and I cross-examine Hyrum and Verlan. As I repeatedly told Lewises, I agree 85%. Which leaves plenty of room for my minimalist Simplistic Theory of Left and Right to breathe. But 85% isn’t good enough for the Lewis brothers. These scholars want unconditional surrender. Agree or disagree, their attitude is most refreshing. Here’s the full conversation: Though the interview runs 75 minutes, I was only able to ask two-thirds of my questions. In the hope that one or both of the authors will write a guest post to fill in the gaps, here are my unasked questions. 1. What are the three best bodies of evidence in your favor? 6. Aren’t you holding essentialists to too high of a bar?  At any given time, leftist and rightist thinkers disagree, so there’s got to be some room for indeterminacy, right? 11. You seem willing to accept sub-level essentialism, like “support for economic freedom” or “hawkish foreign policy.”  But don’t all of your arguments about the logical independence (or “granularity”) of issues apply here, too? 12. Quote from p.79 on raw tribalism versus intellectualized tribalism.  True? 13.  “The essentialist paradigm is making everyone stupid and evil.”  Thinking again on a continuum, what’s the marginal effect?";493
No Quarrel With the People of X;https://betonit.substack.com/p/no-quarrel-with-the-people-of-x;During the Cold War, mainstream politicians often said things like, “We have no quarrel with the people of the Soviet Union. Only their government.” Right before the 1991 invasion of Iraq, George Bush’s letter to Saddam Hussein stated: I am writing you now, directly, because what is at stake demands that no opportunity be lost to avoid what would be a certain calamity for the people of Iraq. I am writing, as well, because it is said by some that you do not understand just how isolated Iraq is and what Iraq faces as a result… Let me state, too, that the United States will not tolerate the use of chemical or biological weapons or the destruction of Kuwait's oil fields and installations. Further, you will be held directly responsible for terrorist actions against any member of the coalition. The American people would demand the strongest possible response. You and your country will pay a terrible price if you order unconscionable acts of this sort. I write this letter not to threaten, but to inform. I do so with no sense of satisfaction, for the people of the United States have no quarrel with the people of Iraq. Bush’s son said the same in 2002: “We have absolutely no quarrel with the Iraqi people.” The cynical take is to scoff, “That will be a great comfort when you kill my entire family.” Or to quote a headline from The Onion, “Dead Iraqi Would Have Loved Democracy.” Collective guilt is the guiding principle of modern warfare: We can freely murder, starve, and torment the citizens of X to try to defeat the government of X. Black humor is like food. Not everyone gets it. Yet there is a more optimistic take. During the Cold War, the U.S. government actually acted on this “We have no quarrel with the people of X” principle. How? First and foremost, by welcoming the citizens of the Soviet bloc as refugees. A consistent believer in collective guilt would say, “Why should we let you come here? You’re one of the enemy.” Standard U.S. policy, however, told Soviet-bloc escapees: “Like us, you’re a victim of an evil system. You’ve got asylum.” The cynical take on this optimistic take is that the U.S. only welcomed the citizens of the Soviet bloc as long as Communist emigration restrictions ensured a low flow of refugees. Once the bloc crumbled, the U.S. government quickly backpedaled. See the arbitrary hypocrisy of “Wet Foot, Dry Foot.” Still, the optimistic take on the cynical take on the optimistic take comes down to: Better than nothing. Even a half-hearted commitment to “We have no quarrel with the people of X” is far superior to “All X’s are our enemies.” So what? The last few years, I’ve heard much hawkish talk about the evils of “the Russians” and “the Chinese.” With rare exceptions, I hear no major foreign policy analysts patiently explaining, “Our quarrel is not with the Russian people” or “Our quarrel with not with the Chinese people.” And if you look at the way Western governments now treat ordinary Russians and Chinese, it really shows. If the governments of Russia and China are tyrannical - and they are - a rational observer would remember to ask, “Who do they tyrannize over?” The primary answer is, perforce, their own citizens. This July, I taught scores of summer school students from China. I can only imagine what they think when they read American publications denouncing “the Chinese.” It’s almost like Western writers are trying to reinforce the paranoia propaganda of the Chinese Communist Party: “The West hates us.” You could insist, “Everyone knows that ‘The Chinese are doing bad stuff’ means ‘The Chinese government is doing bad stuff.’” When everyone is perfectly calm, that’s probably true. Unfortunately, hardly anyone is ever calm when they’re thinking about foreign nemeses. Habitually affirming the distinction between X’s and their government hardly guarantees that you won’t terribly mistreat X’s. But failing to make this distinction almost guarantees that you will. Doesn’t this “almost guarantee” that we’re terribly mistreating Russians and Chinese already? Yes - and we are. Many millions of Russians and Chinese would love to escape from tyranny the only way they know how - by moving to the West. If you respond: “Why should we? They’re the enemy,” I don’t know what else to say. True, most Russians and Chinese are not active dissenters. The vast majority are normal, apolitical people. They’re victims of tyranny nonetheless. The only credible argument not to take them all is some version of “Welcoming tens of millions of migrants would be a disaster.” If that’s where you stand now, I’m tempted to refer you to my Open Borders. Though perhaps it would be more convincing just to point to the Ukrainian refugee non-crisis. Since the war started, millions of Ukrainians have fled to the EU. If you look at final destinations, Germany and Poland each have about a million. Relative to population, that’s like the U.S. admitting over 5 million refugees in about a year and half. Compare this to Biden’s so-called “open borders” plan to admit a total of 30,000 Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans, and Venezuelans per month. As usual, the issue is not “state capacity” but “state priorities.” Jargon-free: Where there’s a will, there’s a way. We can easily welcome many millions of victims of tyranny. Issue their papers and they can take care of themselves. If you fear and hate their governments, strive to remember who your quarrel is with.;952
Vivek's Civics;https://betonit.substack.com/p/viveks-civics;"The most-discussed paragraph in my The Myth of the Rational Voter is probably: Would we still have a ""democracy"" if you needed to pass a test of economic literacy to vote? If you needed a college degree? Both of these measures raise the economic understanding of the median voter, leading to more sensible policies. Franchise restrictions were historically used for discriminatory ends, but that hardly implies that they should never be used again for any reason. A test of voter competence is no more objectionable than a driving test. “Make voters pass a test of political knowledge” was hardly central to my thesis. You could even aver that I was “just spitballing.” So why the strong reaction? Because normal people are democratic fundamentalists. They regard democracy as sacred. To deny the severely ignorant the right to vote isn’t merely ill-advised; it’s evil. Back in 2013, I proposed a watered-down version, where people with good scores gain money rather than voting privileges. Even that was beyond the pale for most folks. Via Electionbettingodds.com Imagine my surprise, then, to read that a major presidential candidate - Vivek Ramaswamy - has suddenly proposed a version of my idea! Betting markets now put Vivek second to Trump to win the Republican nomination. And here’s what he says: We’re not a direct democracy. We are a constitutional republic. We need to revive civic duty among young Americans. That’s why I’m announcing my support for a constitutional amendment to raise the voting age from 18 to 25, but to still allow 18-year-olds to vote if they either pass the same civics test required of immigrants to become naturalized citizens, or else to perform 6 months of military or first responder service. We must be ambitious. I understand not everyone will like this proposal and that it will take persuasion to convince many of its merits, but I’m ready to take that on. My impulsive reaction is to start fault-finding. “Wait, how come only young voters have to pass the test?” “Shouldn’t you at least test the elderly, too?” “Why not let precocious kids vote?” “Isn’t the current civics test way too easy?” My reflective reaction, though, is to drop my jaw in astonishment. Vivek’s a smart, successful guy. He’s doing well in the polls. Could he really fail to realize how radically unpopular his proposal will be? Given how Democratic young voters are, the simplest story is that Vivek hopes to cement his own electoral prospects. But think about how crazy this so-called “strategy” is. Vivek would have to win the presidency before he could effectively push his amendment. Then, and only then, could he deliberately antagonize a large majority of the population. What. A. Plan. Remember, moreover, that objective self-interest is a terrible predictor of political beliefs. Vivek’s amendment benefits Republicans and the elderly, but you can hardly expect them to vote for it because they benefit. Indeed, if you really believe in self-interested voting, just try explaining how the voting age fell from 21 to 18 in the first place. Once you’re old enough to vote, why would you want to dilute your own political influence? Yet Americans over the age of 21 did precisely that. Morally, the case for testing voter knowledge is strong indeed. You should only participate in the political process if you know what you’re doing. As Jason Brennan shows, anything less is negligent. And since self-interest has little effect on political views, the fruit of an informed electorate would not be policies “biased” in favor of the rich, but policies better-crafted to advance the common good. Since Vivek’s proposal affects only a small share of the electorate, the gains would be small. Still, it’s a move in the right epistocratic direction. I’m not crazy. President Vivek remains a long shot - and even if he becomes the next president, I know his amendment will never fly. Before long, I suspect even he’ll stop talking about it. But I can still daydream. P.S. Some of Vivek’s critics accuse him of favoring “unlimited skilled immigration” but I’ve sadly failed to confirm this.

Make 200,000 Mistakes;https://betonit.substack.com/p/make-200000-mistakes;"In the spirit of my “Do Ten Times As Much,” here’s a guest post from former Mormon missionary Jedediah Russell on how to learn a foreign language. Reprinted with his permission. Hello Dr. Caplan, I grew up in a white, English-speaking household. However, I am now fully fluent in Spanish as a result of serving a full-time two-year mission for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints in East Los Angeles (about a year in the barrios of Lincoln Heights/Highland Park and a year in Chino/Pomona) from 2012-2014. I now live in a primarily Spanish-speaking household homeschooling three bilingual children. We attend a Spanish congregation for our Church and most of our friends (and most of my wife's family) either exclusively or primarily speak Spanish. A missionary's first 6-10 weeks is spent at the Missionary Training Center where they undergo intense days of 8-10 hours of instruction, the majority of which is on basic grammatical structure and vocabulary. If you ever pass through Provo, Utah, I highly recommend you call and schedule a tour of the Missionary Training Center. It's something to behold. A teacher of mine framed the challenge of learning a language in an immensely helpful way. Instead of a question of time, he invited us to look at it as a question of quantity of mistakes. It essentially states ""to learn to speak, read, and write a language well it takes 200,000 mistakes made by you in front of others, many of which will be funny, frustrating, and even embarrassing. But there is no getting around that number, so you might as well get them over with as soon and as fast as possible."" This framing was immensely helpful for me. Missionaries are always in pairs (called 'companionships'), so my experience isn't just based on me learning a language, but the 15 other missionaries I witnessed trying to learn a second language. The level of comfort with making mistakes was, in my observation, the key to how well and how fast a person learned Spanish. Missionaries diligent in their language study still struggled to become fluent if they did not put themselves in situations where they would make mistakes. Missionaries that had a hard time sitting still enough for study but were able to recognize that a mistake isn't the end of the world thrived.";406

He's the One;https://betonit.substack.com/p/hes-the-one;"I recently shared my advice for men on finding a wife. Now I’m going to share my advice for women on finding a husband. While a few bigots will object to the idea of males advising females, the only question that genuinely matters is whether my guidance is good. To start, most of my advice for men turns out to be gender-neutral. Including all of the following: Figure out your top priorities - and be flexible about everything else. Give personality a very high priority and looks a low priority. In ordinary language, look for partners who are: happy, rational, loyal, and self-disciplined - and avoid partners who are sad, emotional, fickle, or impulsive. In terms of the Five Factor Model of personality: Strongly avoid Neurotics. Strongly prefer partners with high Conscientiousness. Remember that Agreeableness is a mixed bag, because irrationality is baked into being “highly Agreeable.” Prefer partners close in Extraversion and Openness to yourself. If you want kids, remember that virtually all traits are heritable. You are choosing to have kids who resemble your partner physically, mentally, and morally. Intelligence functions like a personality trait. High is good, but a large gap is bad because it impairs communication and common interests. While common interests are good, common values are better. Above all, find a partner who wants about the same number of kids as you do. Profile and be friendly to build a large pool of possibilities. If you already personally know any man who seems promising, directly tell him and see what happens. Tongue-tied? You can do way worse than “You seem promising.” Ask to hold hands on the first date. Once you’ve got a boyfriend, the main question to ponder is: Does he sincerely consider you supremely deserving of sweet treatment? Spending lots of time together isn’t just a good test of whether you want to spend the rest of your life together; it’s also a chance to discover concealed or suppressed personality traits. The treatment you receive over time will almost certainly get worse. The key question to ask is: Where’s the asymptote? An asymptote at 2/3rds of the max is top-notch. Don’t just think of yourself as a consumer, asking “How can I get what I want?” Simultaneously think of yourself as a producer, asking, “How can I be what he wants?” The marriage market is a market where marketing matters. Now I turn to gender-specific advice: For women, the best thing to be flexible about is age. Think about everything that disappoints you about young men. Although many men never age out of their flaws, a large share do. Instead of picking a young guy and hoping he’ll improve, why not find an older guy who already meets your standards? If your standards are reasonable, 5-10 years will probably suffice. Too gross? Well, you’re supposed to give looks low priority, anyway. The correct priorities are: Personality>Financial Success>Looks. The good news is that desirable personalities have a strong positive effect on financial success, so the trade-off is modest. The main hurdle is that very high-earning guys usually have poor work-life balance. What good is a lovable spouse you barely see? Instead of profiling financially successful guys, profile guys who are financially successful relative to their work hours. Machismo may be sexy in the short-run, but it’s a heavy burden in the long-run. Especially if you plan to have kids. Remember, virtually all traits are heritable. You do not want a son prone to aggression, substance abuse, or other scary tendencies. Do you want a guy who talks about his feelings? Some guys simply hate opening up no matter what. Most guys, however, don’t tell women about their feelings because they correctly expect little sympathy and much judgment. Violate these expectations. Especially if you score as highly Neurotic on personality tests, strive to replace your impulsive angry and sad reactions to men’s confessions with bemusement. “Really?!” goes over far better than “How could you say such a thing?!” In the short-run, men respond to both criticism and praise. Criticism is more impulsively appealing, but praise is a much better bet for inspiring durable devotion. “X upsets me” is grossly inferior to “I love it when you do not-X.” Why? Because most men crave female admiration, yet receive next to none. They are starving for admiration, even if they don’t realize it. Consistently give it without irony and they will love you. And if you set your priorities right, you won’t mind bestowing your admiration because you will be with an admirable man. The male strangers who approach you are loaded with confidence, but they are utterly unrepresentative of their kind. The typical guy, no matter how otherwise awesome, is painfully shy because he expects rejection. Believe it or not, the modal number of reported lifetime sexual partners for men equals one. The best interpretation of this is that most men only master their own fear of rejection a few times over the course of their entire lives! As soon as they find a woman who accepts their overtures, a routine response is to breathe a sigh of relief and quit looking forever. Upshot: The woman who discards the traditional “Men have to ask me” social norm has a superpower. Just profile guys who meet your standards and take the initiative, and you generate a menu of prime options. Yes, conventional wisdom says that a woman can subtly let a guy know that she likes him. But this overlooks men’s abject cluenessness and timidity. Instead, be forthright. Crazy as it seems, earnestly telling your first choice, “I should be your girlfriend” will almost never be mistaken for “throwing yourself” at a guy. Rather, these words send exactly the right message: We should try being together and see if we’re a match. You needn’t be an extreme extravert to pull this off. 3% of Avril Lavigne’s energy will suffice. Avrilian directness also helps weed out men who are afraid of commitment. Changing a person is hard. Building a large pool of options and selecting your favorite person isn’t easy either, but it is easier. Don’t be a feminist. I wrote an essay to my daughter on this - and a book with the same title - and they’re both worth reading. But if you have no patience for social science and moral philosophy, just be agnostic - and spurn antipathy and self-pity. Live not by loathing. Instead of worrying about whether our society treats men more fairly than women, focus on getting good treatment for yourself - and giving good treatment to others. Remember: Life already hands couples an ample supply of conflict. You don’t need a philosophy that paints your partner as a presumptive villain. (And no, I don’t think this is a straw man of feminism. It is rather a harsh statistical reality). Freely play the “I’m not one of those feminists” card with men. Yes, most young men will tolerate feminists - or actually pretend to agree. But mainly because they prioritize looks over personality and values. If you want to get married, you don’t want toleration or feigned agreement. You want earnest mutual devotion: “Two Against the World.” The “I’m not one of those feminists” card is a strong signal that you are open to such devotion. Playing the “I’m Not One of Those Feminists” card liberally makes you likeable to a large pool of men. Then you can select your favorite. This is much wiser than making suitors pretend to agree with you, then trying to convert them once you’re together. Only use “Mad? Why would I be mad?” as a last resort. Indeed, strive to avoid intimidation of any kind; while fear can work, you are playing with fire. Start with the assumption that your partner means well. If they don’t understand you, the main reason is that understanding anyone other than oneself is hard. (Even understanding yourself is no small feat!) Asking clearly yet sweetly works extraordinarily well for women. The only notable danger is that it works so well that you’ll be tempted to over-ask. “Women marry hoping their husbands will change; men marry hoping their wives won’t change. And they’re both usually disappointed.” It’s a truism because it’s truthy. The main lessons for women are: Select a man who delights you as is. Also: You can excel simply by trying to change slowly.";1439
Rufo Responds;https://betonit.substack.com/p/rufo-responds;"In the comments, Rufo responded yesterday to the questions I didn’t get to ask during our interview. I repost them here in full, with reformatting for clarity. I’m in bold, he’s not. The obvious question for Angela Davis and Derrick Bell: If you could succeed in racist America, why can’t everyone? What would they say? What’s the truth? I address this in the chapter on Bell, showing that his own parents modeled the behavior and values that allowed for his success, which he then foolishly denounced in favor of a cynical ideology. I say that “systemic” is the word that makes “racism” a tautological accusation. A normal racist story about high black incarceration rates, for example, is that blacks get punished more for the same crime. “Systemic racism” is what you say when faced with ironclad evidence that higher black crime rates fully account for higher black incarceration rates. Am I being fair? The phrase ""systemic racism"" is a mirage—it's unfalsifiable and unmeasurable. It's a persuasive rhetorical device that, at heart, seeks to explain group disparities in outcomes, many of which are caused by group disparities in behavior, as evidence of racism. Who’s the Marcuse of feminism? Of gender ideology? Foucault. All of gender theory and queer theory finds its foundation in Foucault, who turned Nietzsche into a tool for the Left on sexuality. What was worse in practice: McCarthyism or DEI? DEI, by far. McCarthyism was mild and benign by comparison. You’ve made a lot of right-wing enemies. Probably the most common accusation is that you want to use government to replace our left-wing monoculture with a right-wing monoculture. Is there any truth to this? There is not. My goal is to have public institutions that reflect the values of the public. In blue states, this will be oriented to the Left. In red states, this will be oriented to the Right. I want to see more balance, which will require some political intervention. A healthy republic will have a variety of views competing in the public debate. We don't have that now. That's why I'm working to change it. Quick follow-ups from me. If asked, “If you could succeed in racist America, why can’t everyone?” Bell presumably wouldn’t say that he owes it all to good parenting. That would swiftly lead him to blame lower black achievement on bad parenting rather than racism. I suppose he could insist that bad parenting in turn reflects “systemic racism” but that’s a stretch even for him. Given his anger against Harvard, I suspect that he’d rather credit his success to tokenism and luck, which allows him explain his personal good fortune while retaining racism as the primary cause of lower overall black performance. Glad to hear Chris’ answers on “systemic racism” and McCarthyism. I agree on both counts. “My goal is to have public institutions that reflect the values of the public.” Really? What if the values of the public are terrible? If the public wants to teach dogma as fact, does Chris really support that? I doubt it. I’d say the more Rufo slogan is “My goal is to have public institutions reflect the true, the good, and the beautiful,” even though critics could readily declare, “Right, those are codewords for a right-wing monoculture.” My view: As a practical matter, educators, artists, and journalists are so woke that worrying about a right-wing monoculture in any U.S. state is just paranoid. Montana could have a rigid rule of “Non-left sociologists always get hired first” and its sociology departments would still end up heavily left. So while its reasonable to wonder if Chris would like a mirror-image monoculture, it’s not reasonable to wonder if he’ll get it.";644
Reflections on Rufo;https://betonit.substack.com/p/reflections-on-rufo;"Compared to his social media, Chris Rufo’s best-selling America’s Cultural Revolution is surprisingly coy. Under questioning, he opened up. Here are my chief thoughts: Chris has a much more sympathetic view of Herbert Marcuse, Angela Davis, Paolo Freire, Derrick Bell, and the critical theorists generally than I do. I see these figures and their whole intellectual tradition (narrowly, the Frankfurt School; broadly, Continental philosophy) as intellectually fraudulent. Chris decidedly disagrees. He values their search for truth, admires their idealism, and actually expresses pity for their disappointment with the real world. In hindsight, I shouldn’t have been surprised. After all, Rufo told Hanania: I spent a lot of time with these four people, reading everything from their main works to their articles and interviews and correspondence and notebooks, these huge volume sets, or actually going into the archives at their collected papers and seeing what they were doing. And I actually came away with this kind of, not even a grudging respect, but a kind of respect of mutual recognition at least as far as my own interpretation, feeding back and engaging with their work. It felt as if I gained a deeper understanding of these people and the reason why I spent so much time in the book kind of telling their story, a bit weaving in their biography, is that ultimately these are people I think all of whom were idealists at one point in their lives. And for me, their stories are the story of the modern left, or maybe the perpetual story of the left is idealism and disillusion. And so I understood why they believed what they believed. I grew to respect them even as intellectuals. Why do I deem the critical theorists intellectually fraudulent? Simple: Actual intellectuals construct arguments capable of convincing their critics, or at least the undecided. Which in turn means (a) starting with common-sense premises that seem obvious to people who don’t share your worldview, and (b) carefully reasoning from these obvious premises to not-so-obvious conclusions. In contrast, pseudo-intellectuals like Marcuse, Davis, Freire, and Bell primarily preach to the choir and appeal to emotion. If you watch the interview, Chris seems to grant my accusation that Marcuse just “preaches to the choir,” and can’t produce any example of a Marcusean argument that even tries to convince unbelievers. Perhaps committed Marcuseans could better meet my challenge, but can you imagine Marcuse agreeing to a bet?! To me, this package is damning evidence of intellectual fraud, but Chris still stands up for Marcuse’s merits as a thinker. I understand where Chris is coming from: He’s clearly read a giant stack of critical theory, and frowns on his ignorant allies who dismiss thinkers they’ve never read. Fair enough, but I must protest: After reading some thousands of pages of Continental philosophy, I still dismiss the whole tradition.* Enough is enough. Though the sheer word-count of Continental writing staggers the imagination, this work is vacuous rambling that boils down to a pile of Orwellian doublethink. While I grant that a specific Continental thinker might have something insightful to say about something, this is despite their corrupt approach to ideas, not because of it. Not only does Chris overrate the intellectual quality of the stars of critical theory; he fails to see what moral monsters they were. How so? The critical theorists start with an intellectually negligent intellectual method, short on actual arguments but long on emotion. They reach murderous, totalitarian conclusions; Marcuse, Davis, and Freire were outright communists. After reaching these absurd conclusions, they refuse to reexamine their starting point. If and when they visited their Marxist “utopias,” they remain undeterred. They were, in short, fanatics. Since the conscientious pursuit of truth is virtuous, fanaticism is the ultimate intellectual vice. Being a fanatic is the intellectual equivalent of firing a gun into a random crowd and hoping you shoot Hitler. Due to your negligent selection process, you almost almost end up in severe error. And even if you do miraculously hit the truth, your method was still reckless. Fanaticism is especially vicious if you’re a professional intellectual. When ideas are your career, keeping your emotions under control and second-guessing your conclusions is your job. And the greater the intellectual’s intelligence, the more culpable irrationality becomes. Chris protests that the American Founding Fathers were “fanatics,” too. Maybe a few, but not most. Unlike, say, The Communist Manifesto, The Federalist Papers (and The Anti-Federalist Papers) don’t just emote all over their critics. They actually try to start with common sense and construct arguments to persuade people who don’t already agree with them. I say this despite my long-standing opposition to the American Revolution. The American revolutionaries erred, but I’ll still give them a B for intellectual effort. If I correctly grasp Chris’ position, his big problem with Marxism is just that its grossly mistaken view of human nature leads to total disaster. In a sense, he’s right. The reason we’re still talking about the evil of Marxism is the ~100M body count. But the fanaticism was what got the Marxists to not only launch mass murder, but persist in their murderous ways. The rank-and-file fanatics were evil, the intellectual fanatics were worse, and the admittedly high-IQ intellectuals at the top were about as evil as humans get. I was only mildly surprised that Chris strongly disavowed the “By any means necessary” slogan. While he enjoys playing l’enfant terrible on Twitter, his actual policy proposals are consistently moderate. Take education. His top goals are to (a) take wokeness out of the public school curriculum, and (b) get school choice. “Public schools shouldn’t impose extreme left-wing dogma on the whole student body” and “Fund students not systems”: hardly a well-crafted plan to create a right-wing monoculture. I have spent over a year telling libertarians to appreciate Chris Rufo. I even made him this meme of gratitude: After I scheduled my interview with Chris, he tweeted this: I was unhappy, for many reasons. On the most personal level, I’m a libertarian, and I want to be friends with Chris. I definitely don’t want him to hate me. Furthermore, most of my friends are libertarians, and I don’t want anyone to hate them, either. On a more substantive level, I say that libertarians should support at least 80% of what Chris is trying to accomplish in the real world. Petty infighting is a classic libertarian vice; Chris’ anti-libertarian tweet is another sign that despite his denials, he’s one of us. I’m only half-joking. I end the interview by bringing up this Twitter unpleasantness. For what it’s worth, Chris backpedaled quite a bit. Was he just humoring me? You decide. Either way, I’m still glad I interviewed Chris, and I’m grateful that he’s making higher ed less awful. All of my closest friends have said much crazier things than “I hate libertarianism.” And as I’ve said before, I don’t judge people by the worst thing they’ve said. I just them by their track records. By my count, Chris’ track record is very good indeed. Quite a few people are puzzled by my affection for Chris. But it’s not so puzzling. I obviously don’t agree with everything he says or does, but I agree with at least 80% of it. Probably more like 90%. Though millions of people complain about wokeness, Chris is one of the few people successfully doing anything about it. If his many fanatical critics were right to call Chris a “fascist,” I would be anti-Chris. As usual, however, the fanatics are mired in error. Indeed, since one of my main criticisms of Chris is that he’s too forgiving of the Founding Parents of Wokeness, I suspect his fanatical detractors would say I’m a bigger fascist than he is. P.S. I didn’t have time to ask Chris the following questions. I wonder what he would have said? Chris, if you’re reading this, consider this a standing invitation to write a guest post in response… The obvious question for Angela Davis and Derrick Bell: If you could succeed in racist America, why can’t everyone?  What would they say?  What’s the truth? I say that “systemic” is the word that makes “racism” a tautological accusation.  A normal racist story about high black incarceration rates, for example, is that blacks get punished more for the same crime.  “Systemic racism” is what you say when faced with ironclad evidence that higher black crime rates fully account for higher black incarceration rates.  Am I being fair? Who’s the Marcuse of feminism?  Of gender ideology? What was worse in practice: McCarthyism or DEI? You’ve made a lot of right-wing enemies.  Probably the most common accusation is that you want to use government to replace our left-wing monoculture with a right-wing monoculture.  Is there any truth to this? * There are a few borderline cases: Kant, most notably, has one foot in real Anglo-American philosophy and one foot in fake Continental philosophy. He’s not a fountain of wisdom, but neither is he a waste of words like Hegel or Marx or Marcuse.";1566
How Not to Be an Effective Altruist;https://betonit.substack.com/p/how-not-to-be-an-effective-altruist;I’m a big fan of the Effective Altruism movement, but I have noticed an unfortunate tendency to obsess over bizarre issues primarily because they are intellectually engrossing. The Doomsday Argument. The AIs will exterminate us panic. Shrimp welfare. Which, as this passage from Tolstoy’s Anna Karenina illustrates, is a long-standing problem among self-conscious humanitarians: Konstantin Levin regarded his brother as man of great intelligence and education, noble in the highest sense of the word, and endowed with the ability to act for the common good. But, in the depths of his soul, the older he became and the more closely he got to know his brother, the more often it occurred to him that this ability to act for the common good, of which he felt himself completely deprived, was perhaps not a virtue but, on the contrary, a lack of something - not a lack of good, honest and noble desires and tastes, but a lack of life force, of what is known as heart, of that yearning which makes a man choose one out of all the countless paths in life presented to him and desire that one alone. The more he knew his brother, the more he noticed that Sergei Ivanovich and many other workers for the common good had not been brought to this love of the common good by the heart, but had reasoned in their minds that it was good to be concerned with it and were concerned with it only because of that. And Levin was confirmed in this surmise by observing that his brother took questions about the common good and the immortality of the soul no closer to heart than those about a game of chess or the clever construction of a new machine. Of course, this is a minor flaw compared to the Leninist practice of negligently doing massive evil in the vague hope of realizing a “greater good.” As I’ve previously explained: The key difference between a normal utilitarian and a Leninist: When a normal utilitarian concludes that mass murder would maximize social utility, he checks his work!  He goes over his calculations with a fine-tooth comb, hoping to discover a way to implement beneficial policy changes without horrific atrocities.  The Leninist, in contrast, reasons backwards from the atrocities that emotionally inspire him to the utilitarian argument that morally justifies his atrocities. While I’m on the topic, Hanania is right that EA must either become anti-woke or die: If you’re giving a lecture on a university campus and a young student starts crying about how your ideas are putting her in danger, the only real options are to turn her into an object of mockery and contempt, or to submit and let her decide what you’re allowed to say. Conservatives take the former approach, while the vast majority of journalistic and academic institutions have taken the latter option. Either path can lead to a stable equilibrium. What isn’t stable is taking a sort of in-between position. P.S. I’m always happy to speak to EA clubs whenever I’m nearby. I’m most eager to sell EAs on open borders and housing deregulation, but we could even talk about this very post!;545
The Immigration Game;https://betonit.substack.com/p/the-immigration-game;The Cato Institute has created a new videogame to simulate the U.S. immigration process. As a fan of creative pedagogy, I strongly approve. Summary of “The Green Card Game,” via Alex Nowrasteh: The Green Card Game is an unusual product for the Cato Institute, but we decided to take a chance and make it for several reasons. First, we hypothesize that many people oppose immigration liberalization because they don’t know how complex and restrictive the immigration system is. Many years ago, I spoke to a conservative audience in Arizona about immigration. Afterward, an elderly woman asked, “I understand the benefits of immigration, but why don’t the illegals just go to the Post Office to register and become legal? What are they hiding?” Those questions are reasonable if you know nothing about the legal immigration system. Her question was spurned by ignorance, not by malice. As a result, we’ve identified ignorance of the actual laws as a significant problem in liberalizing immigration. Just imagine how hard it would be to talk about tax policy with someone who doesn’t know that the U.S. has an income tax or even what it is. That’s about where we are in terms of the immigration debate. Our game will teach people some of the basic facts so we can then have a better discussion. A few game options: For American players, I recommend starting by playing as yourself. Create a character with your age, education level, occupation, income, savings, and family with one critical change: Choose to be from another country. Many of us won the birth lottery by being born in the United States. See if you could have come here legally if you lost that lottery, but all else remained the same. Another way to play is to enter the name of an ancestor. Pick a relative when they immigrated to the United States and choose their level of education, occupation, and country of origin. If they’re from the Austro-Hungarian Empire, you’ve got a choice of countries. See if your ancestor could come to the United States legally today. You could also play as a living immigrant family member or friend. Enter their biographical information best as possible and get a sense of what they went through to come here. At a minimum, it will give you a new respect for what they went through to become an American. You could even share the game with them to see if you could conjure any memories in them. A few years ago, I went to Australia’s immigration website to see how Australia’s point system would work for a Princeton Ph.D. like myself. Result: Australia doesn’t want my kind! Even if I were in my twenties, I’d still be below the bar. Call me biased, but what a draconian system.;480
Rousseau and the Collectivist Concept of Freedom;https://betonit.substack.com/p/rousseau-and-the-collectivist-concept;"Some of the major figures of the Enlightenment included Cesare Beccaria, Denis Diderot, David Hume, Immanuel Kant, Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, John Locke, Montesquieu, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Adam Smith, Hugo Grotius, Baruch Spinoza, and Voltaire. — Wikipedia on “The Age of Enlightenment” Jean-Jacque Rousseau Which of these thinkers is unlike the others? The correct answer is, of course, Rousseau. Everyone else on the list was a genuine fan of rationalism or individual freedom. Usually both. Rousseau, despite his personal ties to key Enlightenment figures, carved out a staunchly contrary position - irrationalist and statist to the core. To call him a generic “national socialist” would be quite fair. If Orwell’s “Freedom Is Slavery” slogan ever struck you as over-the-top, try Rousseau’s notorious line from The Social Contract: Whoever refuses to obey the general will will be forced to do so by the entire body; this means merely that he will be forced to be free. Why bring up Rousseau? Because the next installment of “lost lectures” of the late great George Walsh explores his thought in detail, covering the major works of this “citizen of Geneva” chronologically. As usual, Walsh is meticulous, judicious, and hilarious. This master of intellectual history is harsh, but fair. The first lecture situates Rousseau in the history of ideas, then goes over the Discourse on the Arts and Sciences and the Discourse on the Origin of Inequality: The second lecture turns to the Discourse on Political Economy, Emile, and The Social Contract: The big remaining question, to my mind, is how much real-world influence Rousseau actually had. Pace Brian Leiter, Karl Marx was plainly a big proximate cause of history’s many Marxist despotisms and bloodbaths. If ever there was a smoking gun from ideas to atrocities, the gun’s registered owner was Marx. It’s tempting to similarly blame Rousseau for the horrors of the French Revolution and the Napoleonic Wars. But while Robespierre was indeed a big fan of The Social Contract, the French revolutionaries (a) clearly had an array of intellectual influences, and (b) were deeply confused. Article 4 of the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen manages to sound radically libertarian and savagely statist in rapid sequence. Article 4. Liberty consists in the freedom to do everything which injures no one else; hence the exercise of the natural rights of each man has no limits except those which assure to the other members of the society the enjoyment of the same rights. These limits can only be determined by law. Unfair? Read the whole document and feel the ideological whiplash. It’s Locke, Montesquieu, and Rousseau in a blender. Article 8: “The law shall provide for such punishments only as are strictly and obviously necessary.” Article 6: “Law is the expression of the general will.” What if the “general will” prescribes a punishment that is not strictly or obviously necessary? Hmm, maybe we need a punishment for asking such questions. In the end, my best guess is that the French Revolution would have turned totalitarian with or without Rousseau. You don’t need a national socialist philosopher to come up with lazy bloody slogans like, “No one shall be executed, except by law.” Deep hatred plus fanaticism plus power-hunger will suffice.";548
Why Not Punish Families?;https://betonit.substack.com/p/why-not-punish-families;"“This man has committed treason; his blood is bad; there is traitor's blood in him; that must be wiped out. And in the blood feud the entire clan was wiped out down to the last member. And so, too, will Count Stauffenberg's family be wiped out down to the last member.” —Heinrich Himmler A Sikh murders a Hindi, so Hindus burn down the nearest Sikh neighborhood. The consequentialist case against such collective punishments is usually straightforward: Since the murderer is only one Sikh out of millions, his expected punishment is near-zero. In economic terms, the well-being of the Sikh community is a public good. If “helping the Sikh community” is a flimsy impetus for philanthropy, “harming the Sikh community” is a flimsy deterrent for crime. Indeed, collective punishment is barely more effective than punishing a random scapegoat. “If you commit murder, we will run a national lottery and execute the loser” should scare you about as much as “If you commit a murder, you could be struck by lightning.” 1984 Anti-Sikh Pogrom Unless the relevant collective is your family. Family punishments - also known as “kin punishment” - or, in German, Sippenhaft - have been common throughout history. In modern times, totalitarian regimes like Nazi Germany, Soviet Russia, and modern North Korea have successfully used family punishment to put fear into the hearts of their most courageous opponents. Such tactics work because, as evolutionary psychology predicts, even the most selfish human beings normally care intensely about their blood relatives. “If you rob the Mafia, they’ll come after fellow Sikhs” just sounds odd. “If you rob the Mafia, they’ll come after your family” sends chills down your spine. Now suppose you’re a consequentialist. How do you justify making criminals suffer? The party line is: “Making criminals suffer is, in itself, always bad. The only available moral justification is deterrence: The suffering you save must exceed the suffering you inflict.” My twitter readers even buy this story for Hitler himself: Now notice: You can easily justify family punishments using the same logic consequentialists routinely use to justify individual punishment: “Sure, jailing a murderer’s son seems unjust. But the real question is whether the suffering you save exceeds the suffering you inflict.” Family punishment is especially promising when the offender is (a) hard to catch, (b) already expects to receive your maximum punishment for earlier crimes, (c) doesn’t mind the standard punishment too much, or (d) cares deeply for his family members. Truly, it’s the ideal deterrent for murder-suicide and terrorism: “You’re not scared of the maximum punishment we can inflict? Think again, miscreant!” At this point, I can hear legions of consequentialists desperately rationalizing “the fact” that family punishment always fails a cost-benefit test. My one-word reply: “Seriously?!” Yes, family punishments give perverse incentives to criminals who hate their own families. But regular punishments give perverse incentive to criminals who fear life “on the outside.” Yes, family punishments reduce the incentive of criminals’ relatives to avoid crime: “If I’m going to get punished for my brother’s crimes anyway, I may as well become a criminal myself.” But family punishments also amplify relatives’ incentive to police each others’ criminality: “If I’m going to get punished for my brother’s crimes, I’d better make sure he obeys the law.” What’s clear is that when rulers enforce family punishments, the ruled shiver with terror. Don’t tell me these tactics don’t work. To be clear, I oppose family punishment. Why? Because I am a retributivist. As the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy explains: The concept of retributive justice… is best understood as that form of justice committed to the following three principles: that those who commit certain kinds of wrongful acts, paradigmatically serious crimes, morally deserve to suffer a proportionate punishment; that it is intrinsically morally good—good without reference to any other goods that might arise—if some legitimate punisher gives them the punishment they deserve; and that it is morally impermissible intentionally to punish the innocent or to inflict disproportionately large punishments on wrongdoers. That’s right, I think that inflicting suffering on vicious wrong-doers is morally praiseworthy even in the absence of any deterrent effect. Deterrence is a happy byproduct, but the fundamental point of punishment is to balance the scales of justice. In my Hitler-on-an-island thought experiment, for example, I maintain that the morally correct action is to make Hitler suffer as much as possible. Though you can’t make him die twenty million times, you should try your best to approach that ideal. Horrifying? Perhaps. But the same principle tells us to leave Hitler’s baby alone, even if the deterrent effect is large. Since the baby is innocent, even a mild punishment is morally forbidden. The same goes for the rest of Hitler’s family. Even if Hitler murdered your whole family, you do wrong if you murder his whole family. (Except, of course, in the bizarre scenario where every single person in Hitler’s family merited death for their own actions). What if harming Hitler’s baby was the only way to save the world? As a moderate deontologist, I reluctantly endorse this implication. But only in dire hypotheticals with little real-world relevance. The same goes, of course, for letting the heinously guilty off with a slap on the wrist. If you can end World War II a year early by giving Hitler amnesty for his crimes, you should. Though once you’ve ended the war and got Hitler in chains, the morally best approach is to make him maximally suffer - and claim he died of a heart attack. The reputational harm will be trivial - and his millions of victims deserve no less. To expand on a standard disclaimer: My position on criminal justice is not endorsed by George Mason University, the GMU Econ Department, or (as far as I know) any of my favorite colleagues. Indeed, I suspect that all of the above strongly reject my position. My challenge for readers: Propose any alternative to retributivism that precludes family punishment. Or even a strong moral presumption against family punishment. I wish you luck in this intellectual quest, because you’ll need it.";1047
She's the One;https://betonit.substack.com/p/shes-the-one;"Request from a reader: As a young man myself, let me ask you for some advice on a question that I'm pondering on. What do I look for in a person I'm going to marry? How do I know if she is the one? My response draws on some relevant academic social science and psychology, blended with my cumulative life wisdom… such as it is. The Big Picture: Humans are good at hedonically adapting to most material conditions. You get used to your house, your car, your clothes, your granite countertop, and your money. What humans are bad at hedonically adapting to is… other people. If you spend a lot of time around humans whose company you enjoy, you will probably be happy. If you spend a lot of time around human whose company you detest, you will probably be unhappy.* Over your lifetime, you will probably spend more time around your spouse than any other human. So while finding good friends and good co-workers is crucial for happiness, finding a good spouse is even more so. Upshot: My young reader is asking the right question. And here’s my answer in eighteen parts. Figure out your top priorities - and be flexible about everything else. Discrete cutoffs for continuous variables are almost always silly, whether we’re talking age (“Can’t be older than me”), height (“Must be at least 5’3’’), or IQ (“120 IQ minimum”). Stereotypes say that guys dislike being with a women who is smarter than they are; I’m not convinced that’s true, but don’t let it be true of you. The greatest mistake young people make, especially young males, is giving looks a high priority and personality a low priority. This is beyond foolish. If the most beautiful woman in the world has an ugly personality, you will be soon be miserable. And miserable you shall stay. Short-term physical attraction is something to control or sublimate, not a guide to action. If this sounds hard, I bring good news: If someone has tolerable looks and clearly likes you, you can often become physically attracted to them. There’s a great scene in Shakespeare’s Much Ado About Nothing on this theme: Benedick and Beatrice don’t think about each other romantically until their friends deliberately stage a self-fulfilling illusion of mutual infatuation. So if you prioritize personality, you can - within limits - get physical attraction as free bonus. A good personality is your top priority, but what personalities are “good”? “It depends on your preferences” is a cop-out. So is “There are many different models of personality.” Using ordinary language rather than the Five Factor Model, look for partners who are: happy, rational, loyal, and self-disciplined - and avoid partners who are sad, emotional, fickle, and impulsive. “Complicated” is a euphemism for “malcontent.” Avoid at all costs, along with anyone who medicalizes their character flaws. Our actions are right or wrong, not healthy or sick. If you prefer the framework of the canonical Five Factor Model of personality: First and foremost, strongly prefer partners with low Neuroticism (also known as high “Emotional Stability”). Life is hard enough without being tied for life to someone who sees the dark linings in silver clouds. This is especially important for men, because women score notably higher on Neuroticism, and this probably understates the true size of the gender gap. Secondly, strongly prefer partners with high Conscientiousness. Low Conscientiousness folks can be fun friends, but chiefly because you aren’t responsible for bailing them out of the messes they habitually get themselves into. And if you’re getting married in the first place, you should be with someone who takes the strictures of marriage seriously. Most students of human personality will also advise you to prefer a mate high in Agreeableness, but this is much oversold. Myers-Briggs calls this same personality trait “Thinking versus Feeling,” and this alternative nomenclature is revealing. “High Agreeableness” people are “nice,” but they’re also unreasonable and emotional. You don’t really want a partner who is “nice to everyone”; you want a partner who singles you out as supremely deserving of nice treatment. For the remaining two traits, Extraversion and Openness, your best bet is to find someone similar to yourself. Especially because these are the main traits that predict what activities you will enjoy: People who like big parties (typically high in Extraversion) should pair with other people who like big parties; people who like action movies (typically low in Openness) should pair with others who like action movies. Qualifications: The Five Factor Model recognizes thirty facets or subtraits. The Extraversion facet known as “Positive Emotions” and the Agreeableness facet known as ""Trust” are almost always good; the Agreeableness facet known as “Tender-Mindedness” is almost always bad. If you want kids, remember that virtually all traits are heritable. Always ask yourself, “Does this person have the traits I want my kids to have”? While you may joke, “I don’t want ugly kids,” there’s nothing funny about having kids with bad personalities. Intelligence is not technically a ""personality trait,” but it functions much the same. High intelligence is our best predictor of material success and many other desirable outcomes, but if the intelligence gap between partners is too high they won’t be compatible. Communication across a 20 IQ-point gap is too hard, and so is finding common interests. While common interests are good, common values are better. The difference is hard to define, but easy to illustrate. Backpacking is an interest; desired family size is a value. I am always amazed by couples who have been together for years without discussing how many kids they hope to have. Once you’re clear on your priorities, start energetically profiling in order to meet women with high potential. Above all, cultivate a habit of being extremely friendly to both men and women in order to build a large pool of possibilities. Steel yourself to the ubiquity of rejection. Know that you will must feel more lonely before you can feel less lonely. If you already personally know any woman who seems promising, tell her about it and see what happens. While the stigma against this has gone way up since my youth, especially on-the-job, the expected sanctions are low, especially if you are following my advice to prioritize personality. Hyper-offendable women do exist, but hardly anyone will be offended by an earnest modernization of, “I greatly admire you. You are so often in my thoughts.” Ask to hold hands on the first date. I know this advice seems lame to ultra-confident guys, who insist that asking permission is for betas. But my advice was never aimed at ultra-confident guys. My goal, rather, is to help ordinary shy guys out of the Friend Zone. If a woman refuses to hold hands on the first date, you’re probably in her Friend Zone for life. Bitter to learn, but good to know. And if she accepts, you’re out of the Friend Zone already. Forthrightness might not be the best possible rhetorical tactic, but it’s one of the best. And unlike “game,” almost anyone can pull it off. So far, there is basically no difference between “How do I find a girlfriend?” and “How do I find a wife?” But once you’ve got a girlfriend, how do you know if she’s the one? The main question to ponder is: Does she sincerely consider me supremely deserving of nice treatment? What does “supremely deserving of nice treatment” look like? Watch Samurai Rebellion. No joke, it is the most moving love story I’ve ever seen. I cry watching it. Remember: Actions speak louder than words. Spending lots of time together isn’t just a good test of whether you want to spend the rest of your life together; it’s also a chance to discover concealed or suppressed personality traits. Which, for obvious reasons, are usually negative. Sad, but if there’s something ugly to learn, you want to learn it ASAP. Bitter truth: Even if a woman sincerely considers you supremely deserving of nice treatment now, the treatment you receive will almost certainly get worse. The key question to ask is: Where’s the asymptote? If things start at perfection, and asymptote to 2/3rds of perfection, your marriage is an incredible success. Count yourself lucky! Remember: It’s the marriage market. Don’t just think of yourself as a consumer, asking “How can I get what I want?” Simultaneously think of yourself as a producer, asking, “How can I be what she wants?” Thoughtful search and energetic self-improvement are two great things that go great together. Start by avoiding the standard human flaws of impulsivity, self-absorption, laziness, and self-pity, as well as the standard male flaws of faithlessness, insensitivity, machismo, and drunkenness. And yes, figure out what you want to do with your life. The marriage market is a market where marketing matters. Especially for a guy, simply being awesome gets you almost nowhere. You have to sell yourself. The good news is that most guys are so afraid of rejection that the simplest sales pitch goes a long way. If there’s a 2% chance that she’s the one and you don’t know what to say, look serious and say, “You seem great. Would you go out with me on Saturday?” My 11-year-old daughter vocally opposes changing yourself to better please the marriage market. “You’ve got to be true to yourself,” she declares, with poetic wisdom beyond her years. My reply: Sure, you should think twice - nay, thrice - about violating your conscience for romantic rewards. But what if the marriage market rewards changes that you yourself classify as self-improvement? When the marriage market rewards you for working hard, and you agree that you ought to adopt a better work ethic, hard work is “true to yourself.” We’re all flawed human beings, so you have plenty of room to self-improve with pride. And if women like you better as a result, that speaks well of them, not badly of you. * Or at least as happy/unhappy as you’re capable of being. Genetics matter a lot for happiness, too.";1726
Barbie Defines Feminism;https://betonit.substack.com/p/barbie-defines-feminism;"I met famed sociologist Fabio Rojas at UC Berkeley when he was sixteen years old. We’ve been the best of friends ever since. He was best man at my wedding. And decades later, we’re still arguing about ideas, art, and life. When his Facebook review of Barbie connected the movie to my Don’t Be a Feminist, asked him to expand and expound. Here’s Fab: I wanted to see Oppenheimer this weekend, but I discovered that it was sold out. Rather than go home, I bought a ticket for Barbie, my second choice. I'm a fan of kid's movies and not just the stuff pitched at boys. I enjoyed Frozen, I sat with my daughter through many episodes of My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic and I own some old Power Puff Girls DVDs. Even though I never owned a Barbie doll, I figured that I would enjoy seeing how this particular toy line would be brought to life. Barbie is not what I expected. The movie adopts an adult tone and is much more political than the trailers implied. It completely embraces a brand of modern feminism that has attracted its fair share of critics, including the author of the Bet On It substack. I found myself arguing with the movie. At the same time, I found the movie to be enjoyable and inventive. Given my mixed reactions, Bryan has asked me to share my thoughts.  Let's start with aesthetics. Visually, it exploits the pink theme well. The director, Greta Gerwig, shows us Barbie Land, where homes are pink and built like toys. And I love the fashion - pinks, pastels, and plaids forever! The film showcases a lot of A-list actors, who make the film very easy to watch. Margot Robbie is great in the lead and Ryan Gosling excels. In terms of pacing, the film moves along nicely. It never drags and it is always interesting. In the long run, this will be remembered as a very entertaining movie.  That being said, this is not a kid's film. Rather, it's a fun and humorous political allegory told in a very adult style. Barbie is a postmodern production that makes constant references intended for a mature audience, like a clever Jane Austen joke, an homage to Stanley Kubrick (!) and a discussion of tax evasion (!!). More importantly, the film has a strong progressive viewpoint and a particular audience in mind: college educated 35-year-olds who have a degree in gender studies. I am not exaggerating. The film openly discusses theories of patriarchy at multiple points. As I watched the film, I started quibbling and arguing with its depiction of the ""real world."" Basically, Barbie advocates the type of feminism that Bryan critiques in his book, Don't Be a Feminist. Bryan argues that the distinctive feature of the modern feminist movement is a strong preference for bias, discrimination, and exclusion as the default explanation for gender inequalities. Here is Bryan discussing this perspective: What then is a reasonable definition - a definition that identifies a central point of contention between feminists and non-feminists? Something like this: Feminism is the view that society generally treats men more fairly than women.” (p. 4, italics in the original)  Indeed, at a number of points, Barbie characters say things that seem to directly support this description. For example, Alan, a minor character, literally says, ""I'm a man with no power, does that make me a woman?"" I emphasize that this is not what the filmmaker believes. Rather, it’s a nod toward what the film maker might believe about real world gender relations. At another point, Barbie directly describes why Barbie Land is a mirror image of the Real World, “Basically, everything that men do in your world, women do in ours.”  This theme runs throughout the film. When Barbie shows up in California, she is almost immediately harassed by a man. When Ken and Barbie visit Mattel headquarters, it is run exclusively by men. Women work as the secretaries. As I mentioned earlier, the film has characters who openly talk about patriarchy. Ken’s big lesson from visiting the “real world” is that he should return to Barbie Land and forcibly establish a dude-ocracy. I do not live in a ""men rule"" world. All I need to do is look around me to see women in positions of authority. The president of my university is Pamela Whitten. The current president of my professional association is Prudence Carter, a highly accomplished scholar at Brown University. Three of the last four chairs of my department have been women. There are broader social trends as well. For example, recent data show that a modest majority of medical students are women, as recently reported by the Association of American Medical Colleges.  Also, there’s been marked changes in the legal profession. According to the American Bar Association, women now make up about 55% of law school students, 38% of practicing attorneys, and 22% of equity partners. And of course, some of the world’s largest and most powerful nations have elected female heads of state such as the United Kingdom, Germany, and India. Barbie’s description of Mattel itself is somewhat off the mark. When you watch the film, the executives are all depicted as men with one exception. The ghost of Barbie’s inventor and Mattel co-founder, Ruth Handler, remains in the building. What do we learn if we actually visit Mattel’s Board of Directors website? Five of eleven Board members are women, including the President of Quinnipiac University, the CEO of a major Latin American business conglomerate, and the leader of a large investment firm. To be completely fair, Barbie has a more accurate depiction if you stick to the executive leadership, where only the human resources director is female.  I’m not critiquing Barbie because I think men and women are completely on equal footing. Rather, the strong patriarchy story is incomplete for modern society. The YouTube movie critic “Deep Focus Lens” summarizes things best when she remarked that the “real world” depicted in the film felt more truthful as a setting in the 1960s rather than the 2020s. Social science research backs up this intuition. For example, a 2022 meta-analysis of 70 audit studies in Science Advances found that the degree of pro-male or pro-female bias in hiring depends a lot on factors like the income level of an industry.  ""It's complicated,"" as they say, and I suspect the filmmakers know this, even if they don’t make a big deal out of it. For example, after Ken is liberated from his subservient role in Barbie Land, he tries to rule in the real world and fails. People tell Ken that success requires training for leadership. Your gender is not enough. Barbie also admits that the male executives are well intentioned. After satirizing Mattel's current president, the movie admits that he’s so invested in the company because he wants to make little girls happy - but not in a creepy way! In the end, I enjoyed Barbie despite my disagreements. We can appreciate what the film gets right. It is absolutely true that toys in the pre-Barbie age assumed that mothering was the only thing girls were interested in doing. Men certainly do things that are noxious and undermine women. The film also recognizes that the fantasy world of Barbie Land has its own drawbacks and plenty of problems. Even if Barbie isn’t completely correct in its account of the real world, I’m glad the film is out there for people to see and discuss.";1284

Else: Matthew pays Bryan the current market value of $500 worth of the S&P 500 purchased at the closing price on July 27, 2023. If either of us dies before the bet resolves, the bet is called off. Why bet in terms of the S&P? Because if my opponent is right, $2,000 nominal will be a trivial sum in 2043. Barnett’s thinking? He explains in detail here. Sample: Since computing hardware manufacturing is not bound by the same constraints as human population growth, an AI workforce can expand very quickly — much faster than the time it takes to raise human children. Perhaps more importantly, software can be copied very cheaply. The 'population' of AI workers can therefore expand drastically, and innovate in the process, improving the performance of AIs at the same time their population expands. It therefore seems likely that, unless we coordinate to deliberately slow AI-driven growth, the introduction of AIs that can substitute for human labor could drastically increase the growth rate of the economy, at least before physical bottlenecks prevent further acceleration, which may only happen at an extremely high level of growth by current standards. My thinking? Barnett is falling prey to severe focusing illusion: “Nothing in life is as important as you think it is, while you are thinking about it.” No matter how great a technology may seem, the real world blocks you with hundreds of bottlenecks. Resource bottlenecks. Distribution bottlenecks. Technological bottlenecks. Political bottlenecks. The political bottlenecks are especially insurmountable. How is GWP supposed to more than double in a year in a world where you have to wait a decade just to assemble the right building permits? We don’t need to imagine a Butlerian Jihad against AI, just the same death by a thousand cuts that has strangled nuclear power for the last eight decades. Yes, you can imagine an AI so awesome that when you input, “Tell me how to persuade draconian regulators to approve everything I want by tomorrow,” the output is a foolproof answer. (Though what happens if the regulators input, “Tell me how to stay draconian in the face of AI persuasion”?) But that is absurd fantasy. There is simply an upper bound to how persuasive any being can be. An upper bound now. An upper bound in 2043. An upper bound forever. I’ll bet on it!;648
*Amore Infernale*: The Version That Was;https://betonit.substack.com/p/amore-infernale-the-version-that;Before my latest AI illustration contest to draw my Amore Infernale, I had a regular illustration contest with the same goal. The winning artist, Aljon Dave, eventually quit the project, but not before he drew a gorgeous - and complete - Chapter 1. Until now, I’ve never shared this quarter-finished book with the world. Truth be told, I kept hoping the artist would resume production. By the time I realized he wasn’t going to finish, I was sidetracked by other projects. Since I’m reviving this dream, however, I wish to show you how close we got last time. With some help assembling the art files from David Spearman, here is the best version I can offer. I hope you enjoy it. And I hope even more strongly that my latest illustration contest yields an even more eye-popping final product. P.S. Here are a few alternate versions of the final pages. Enjoy.;155
Raico on Liberty and Its Adversaries;https://betonit.substack.com/p/raico-on-liberty-and-its-adversaries;I first met historian Ralph Raico at a Cato Institute Summer Seminar in 1990. Like George Walsh, Raico was an old-school scholar who published modestly but knew extravagantly. I hung out with Raico at two or three seminars, and he amazed me. The man could expound at length on any historical topic I threw at him, and knew more economics and philosophy than most professors of either subject. Ralph Raico, 1936-2016 With continued technical help from the Salem Center, I am now making two of Raico’s best lost lectures from the 1990s available for your listening pleasure. The first is “Foundations of Classical Liberalism.” The second is “Adversaries of Classical Liberalism.” Like most libertarian scholars who spoke at summer seminars in the 1990s (I attended many!), Raico stubbornly preferred this “classical liberal” label.* Which was confusing even then. When I interned at the Cato Institute in 1991, someone the recounted the following conversation: Random DC Guy: So what do you guys at this Cato Institute believe? Cato Staffer: Well, we’re classical liberals. Random DC Guy: Me too! I just love Ted Kennedy. Why not just use the word “libertarian”? The main objections were aesthetic: The word sounds weird. If memory serves, faculty member Tom Palmer delivered the following spiel at the same 1990 Cato summer school where I met Raico: “Libertarian.” That sounds like a cross between a libertine and a librarian! In any case, never let words get in the way of your edification. In modern parlance, Raico’s talk on “Foundations of Classical Liberalism” is “Foundations of Libertarianism,” and his talk on “Adversaries of Classical Liberalism” is “Adversaries of Libertarianism.” And both talks are wonderful. * My colleague Dan Klein is still quixotically promoting the liberal label even today. With respect, Dan, it’s not happening. P.S. Raico’s total research productivity is less modest than I thought.;314
Cars Could Be Even More Convenient;https://betonit.substack.com/p/cars-could-be-even-more-convenient;While I was in Europe, I ran this guest post on cars and market urbanism by SolarxPvP. He’s on Twitter, but I’ve also met him in real life. Definitely a smart and thoughtful guy, but when he says… The primary problem with current cities is that they are extremely car-centric. We don't realize this because it's just everyday life and we assume that cars make transportation easier and more convenient, but this is false. …he’s almost totally wrong. Cars don’t just happen to be faster. As Glaeser and Kahn explain in the Handbook of Regional and Urban Economics and their “Why Do the Poor Live in Cities?” (Journal of Urban Economics, 2008), cars have a strong inherent speed advantage. Why? Because of fixed time costs. When you use public transportation, you have to (a) walk to the pickup point, (b) wait, (c) travel, then (d) walk to your final destination. When you drive, (a) you get in your car and go straight to your final destination. There is no (b). Glaeser and Kahn elaborate: We found that public transportation appears to involve a fixed time cost of approximately 16–20 minutes, regardless of length. After this fixed time costs, cars appear to be about 50 percent faster than buses and roughly as fast as trains. It is this fixed time cost that makes public transportation so costly. The time spent walking (or driving) to the station or bus stop plus the time spent waiting for the bus or train plus the time spent walking or driving to the final destination appears to take up as much time as driving ten miles. As time has gotten more valuable, the time costs of public transportation have become more severe and the population has continued to move entirely towards the automobile. If you have any doubts, go to Google Maps and compare the travel time for any route that pops into your mind. At the moment, a journey from my office to the White House takes 34 minutes by car but a full 1 hour, 43 minutes by mass transit. Look closely: It’s almost faster to bike the full 18 miles! Think I’m cherry-picking (or “lemon-picking”)? Go to Google Maps, type in any route you can think of, and see what happens. I say cars win at least 90% of the time. Is the problem that I’m focusing on the U.S., notorious for its awful mass transit? I’ve also spent ample time weighing ground transportation options on my many foreign travels. Even in Germany, home of one of the world’s most storied rail systems, cars almost always beat trains.* Bullet trains are the only clear counter-example. Those I’ve taken in Spain and Japan are much faster than cars, but only for a short list of prestige destinations. What about using trains to beat traffic jams and avoid parking problems? Yes, this often works in the most congested cities during the most congested times. But even in such scenarios, the only reason trains outshine cars is that governments stubbornly refuse to implement peakload pricing for roads and parking. Give us well-functioning electronic pricing - and the best argument against cars goes down the drain. From a natalist point of view, moreover, cars plainly rule. I quite enjoy a nice bike ride in the German countryside. Still, to use bikes to transport young kids, groceries, and other purchases is awful. And in bad weather, worse than awful. I vividly remember my first day in Denmark, where I watched the “happiest people in the world” grimly bike in the rain as I drove past them in my taxi. The same goes for trains, busses, and other car-substitutes. Under rarefied conditions, they make parents’ lives easier. Once your kids reach their tweens or teens, you don’t have to chauffer them anymore. Yet for families with younger kids to move around using only mass transit is a giant pain. SolarxPvP is right, of course, that the dominance of cars is partly a government decision. Yet the main reason why cars dominate remains the primordial fact that - with rare exceptions - they’re the most convenient way to travel. Some governments desperately fight this reality. Most reluctantly accept it. A wise government would embrace it. * Doesn’t Germany also have autobahns without speed limits? Sure, but so could every country. Imagine the convenience of peakload pricing on highways where you can drive as fast as you please.;756
*Amore Infernale*: The AI Illustration Contest;https://betonit.substack.com/p/amore-infernale-the-ai-illustration;Sixteen years ago, I wrote and storyboarded my first graphic novel, Amore Infernale. Based on my original role-playing game of the same name, Amore Infernale is the story of three superheroes solving an opera-themed mystery in Verona, Italy in 2005. Vague spoiler: By the end, they discover that Shakespeare got the story of Romeo and Juliet very wrong! Over the years, I’ve tried to find an artist to actually draw my book, but nothing worked out. So in 2020 during high Covid, I ran an illustration contest on Freelancer.com. The winner, Aljon Dave, is tremendously talented. He completed the first of four chapters. Check out how awesome some of his pages are… Last page of Chapter 1. Page 7, Chapter 1. Page 12, Chapter 1. Unfortunately, Dave subsequently resigned. I thought about hiring someone else, but I loved his style so much that I didn’t have the heart to restart the whole project… until the last time I was hanging out with my dear friend - and founder of Major League Pickleball - Steve Kuhn. Steve is an AI enthusiast - and at this point, so am I. He’s also a big graphic novel fan. He bought a thousand copies of my Open Borders. Which piqued his interest in the following question: Is AI ready to draw a full graphic novel - or at least greatly speed up a traditional artist’s work? To unlock the answer, Steve offered to fund a new AI illustration contest for Amore Infernale. Subject to two key conditions: Artists are not only allowed, but strongly encouraged, to take full advantage of any AI they wish. Artists must share details on exactly how they used AI. The software, the prompts, and so on. After wondering how I could be blessed with friends like Steve, I accepted. I just announced the new contest this morning. Everyone is welcome to try their hand. Here’s the full write-up: I am Bryan Caplan, Professor of Economics at George Mason University, and the author of the New York Times Bestselling non-fiction graphic novel *Open Borders: The Science and Ethics of Immigration*. For confirmation of my identity, see https://twitter.com/bryan_caplan/status/1681026328290824193. As a side venture, I've written *Amore Infernale*, an entirely fictional graphic novel. You can download the full script and storyboards here: http://bcaplan.com/ai.pdf. For a previous artist’s attempt at chapter 1, see: http://bcaplan.com/aidave.pdf. Your mission: Combine your artistic ability with any Artificial Intelligence (AI) software to beautifully illustrate my book. Compensation: With the help of generous benefactor Steve Kuhn, I have $10,000 to fund this entire project. I plan to run this contest in THREE stages, each of which releases some of this prize money, as I explain below. Conditions: Any combination of human and AI output is welcome. Entrants can be professional artists who know a little AI, AI professionals who know a little art, or anyone in between. Crucially, when you submit your final drawings, you also need to explain *precisely* how you produced the final product. What AI program(s) did you use? What were your main prompts? How did you get from AI pages to the finished product? My Artistic Vision: I like stunning representational art. In the attached files, you can see some of my previous favorite attempts to illustrate *Amore Infernale*. I also favor traditional color schemes, the kind you'll see in Tintin or P. Craig Russell's *Ring of the Nibelung* adaptation. Even more importantly, though, I love art with a passionate vision. If you're ever in artistic doubt, remember that my favorite composer is Richard Wagner! The Contest: The first stage of the contest will be open to all. I will award ONE first prize of $1000, plus four runner-up prizes of $250 each. During the first stage, draw any 10 pages of my book to show off your craft, vision, determination, and attention to detail. Be sure to explain how you are blending human skill and AI to produce the final pages. The first stage will run for 30 days. The second stage of the contest will be open only to the five semi-finalists, plus no more than two others that I personally approve. During the second stage, the goal is to BEAUTIFULLY ILLUSTRATE AS MUCH OF THE BOOK AS POSSIBLE. I will award ONE final prize of $2,000 to whoever does the best overall job. The second stage will also run for 30 days. The third stage: The winner of the second-stage gets $6,000 when they finish the book to my satisfaction. If the winner does not want to finish the book, or makes little progress over a long period, I retain the right to reassign this opportunity to one of the other contestants in the second stage. If you look at my previous contests, I am diligent at providing artists with careful and honest feedback. Whether you are in striking distance of winning - or don't stand a chance - I will let you know. I know contests are stressful, but I don't want anyone to feel mistreated. While I own the final copyright and all royalties, the final contest winner will receive full artistic credit on the cover and in any promotions I conduct. Whoever you are, I would sincerely love to make you famous! If the contest goes well, I hope to publish the finished book commercially. If that doesn’t take, I’ll figure out another release route. False modesty aside, I think my fiction is good enough for Hollywood, back when Hollywood was good. Long-time readers will probably be able to tell I wrote Amore Infernale, but there’s no didactic agenda. Just emotional truth, and art for art’s sake. Page 23, Chapter 1. Page 24, Chapter 1.;981
What Should I Ask Chris Rufo?;https://betonit.substack.com/p/what-should-i-ask-chris-rufo;"Chris Rufo’s America’s Cultural Revolution, currently #1 on Amazon, releases today. I’ve already finished this surprisingly academic intellectual history of Critical Theory. And in a few weeks, I’m doing a wide-ranging interview with the author himself. If there is anything you’d like me to ask Rufo - anything at all - please share in the comments. While we’re on the topic, I realize that some of my readers are puzzled, even dismayed, by my pro-Rufo stance. What is wrong with me? To start, I still maintain that wokeness is far from the most important evil in the world. Immigration restrictions, housing regulation, nuclear power strangulation, and universal redistribution are all far worse in absolute terms. While it is tempting to declare wokeness the “root cause” of all these evils, that’s just not so. That said, wokeness is a top concern for me personally because I work in academia. This insipid, Orwellian cult really does rule the American university system. The current denial of academic freedom truly is much worse than McCarthyism ever was. And I have seen with my own eyes that woke administrators are plotting, by hook or by crook, to stamp out the last remnants of rational thought in the humanities and social sciences.* How? By getting a stranglehold over hiring. Woke admins don’t think they can get rid of me. I’ll still be teaching my thoughtcrimes in the 2060s. Mark my words. But if they grab a wee bit more power, they will be able to prevent the hiring of anyone like me in the future. Make no mistake: State-supported DEI is not “free expression.” It is an official effort to crush free expression. What thrills me about Chris Rufo? He is almost single-handedly blocking - and reversing - this ongoing on-campus woke power grab. Like many other intellectuals, Rufo shines a righteous spotlight on this insipid, Orwellian cult. Unlike almost every other intellectual, however, Rufo miraculously gets politicians to take desirable action. Even when I question the details of what Rufo’s doing, I’m supremely grateful that he’s on the job. Grateful for myself - and even more grateful for all of the younger dissident scholars who, thanks to Rufo, will be still be able to find work in Texas, Florida, and beyond. A critic accused me of “carrying water” for Rufo, but the reality is that he happily carries water for me - and every reasonable resident of the Ivory Tower - every day. The least we can do is thank him from the bottom of our hearts. But, you may ask, doesn’t Rufo capitalize on rare, vivid events to whip his fans into hysteria? Point granted. Don’t I normally abhor such tactics? I do. Unlike mainstream media, however, he’s fostering hysteria about a genuinely awful problem that he has thoughtfully analyzed first. The hysteria’s not my style, but unlike me, Rufo’s plainly pushing the world in a better direction. Last point: For all the Unpopulists out there, pay close attention to the proverbial dog who didn’t bark. Unlike almost every other “populist,” I’ve yet to hear Rufo say one demagogic word against immigration. Upshot: Rufo isn’t just rolling back wokeness; by dramatically changing the subject, he is making conservatives forget to be mad about immigration. Indeed, I suspect that his medium-run plan is to bring immigrants into the grand anti-woke coalition. Now that’s “inclusion"" as it ought to be. P.S. Disagree? To repeat, please share all your Rufo questions in the comments. * Yes, our education system is a waste of time and money. Yes, austerity is the best remedy. But if you are going to fund this system, at least staff it with reasonable scholars, not woke fanatics.";635
Abusers Give Vice a Bad Name;https://betonit.substack.com/p/abusers-give-vice-a-bad-name;Picture the leading intoxicants: alcohol, opioids, meth. They cause much harm. According to our prevailing civic religion, who are we supposed to resent, stigmatize, and punish in response? First and foremost, the producer. Anyone who makes money off of human misery. Second and secondarily, the typical user. Sure, they rarely experience severe personal blowback. But they normalize deviant behavior. And they put money into the pockets of the vendors of sin, allowing them to flourish. Last and least, the “abuser” or “addict.” Personally, they may disgust us. Yet the bipartisan position is that archetypal abusers are victims who deserve general sympathy and taxpayer assistance. I say that these priorities are confused at best. Visualize a world full of moderate users of every alleged vice. You might not approve, but what’s the big deal? The moderate users do their jobs, live in homes, take care of their families, and keep their friends. They’re not perfect, but who is? The picture doesn’t change if you add thriving legal businesses supplying all these moderate users with their desired products. Sure, you’re afraid of those who produce illegal products. I know I am. But as Prohibition shows, making an industry illegal turns it scary - and relegalizing it turns it back. You might not admire alcohol producers, but you don’t fear them either. Keeping “purveyors of vice” illegal is thus an exercise in futility. At this point, you might protest: Are you blind?! Do you not see the urban camps full of drunks and addicts living in squalor? Spreading filth through the neighborhoods they inhabit? Do you not notice their aggressive begging? Their obvious theft of shopping carts and bicycles? How can you speak of outright legalization when the wreckage of partial legalization is all around us? For God’s sake, read San Fransicko! My answer: I am not blind. While I have not visited the Bay Area in years, I went to college in grotesque Berkeley, California during the People’s Park volleyball lunacy. During Covid, I lived in Austin for months. Encampments were rarely out of eyesight. Last month, my whole family bumped into the hellish addicts’ village just outside the train station in Hannover, Germany. Like normal observers, I’m horrified by such situations - and strive to steer clear of them. I saw much worse than this in Austin, every day I lived there. Where do you think those bikes came from? The difference between me and normal observers: I don’t consider extreme abusers or “addicts” to be victims. I consider them victimizers. They aren’t a symptom of a greater social problem. They are the greater social problem. Abusers have and continue to make evil choices. Granted, it logically possible to end up on Fentanyl Row through tremendously bad luck. Empirically, however, everything I’ve read on poverty convinces me that the root cause of such residence is almost invariably extraordinarily irresponsible behavior. Even a mild dose of the Success Sequence will keep you off the street: Read Adam Shephard’s Scratch Beginnings for a blueprint. Abusers don’t just mistreat their families, friends, neighbors, and passersby. Even worse, they give vice a bad name. Abusers inspire the indiscriminate, unjust “wars” on innocent users. They inspire prohibition, which takes production out of the hands of ordinary businesspeople and into the hands of criminals. For a utilitarian, the obvious solution is to (a) legalize production, (b) legalize use, and (c) harshly punish abuse. You can manufacture and sell opioids. You can buy and use them. But you can’t live on the streets begging, much less create a tent city of bicycle theft in the town square. If you try, you go to jail. How, though, should you react if, like me, you have deep libertarian scruples? Sure, start with stigma: “You’re victimizers, and I’m not giving you money.” But even a strict libertarian can go much further. At minimum, you can impose the standard punishments for theft. Which is easy, because if you examine encampments, ill-gotten wares are in plain sight. Stealing shopping carts is a crime. Stealing bicycles is a crime. It’s crazy for cops to look the other way when shifty characters violate property rights in plain sight. And unless you oppose the very existence of public property, you can also consistently favor enforcement of laws against trespassing on, vandalizing, and defiling public property. Enforcing all of this doesn’t precisely make abuse illegal, but it comes close. Why, though, shouldn’t we just double-down on orthodox prohibitionist remedies? Because you wind up punishing a vastly larger number of innocent people, that’s why. Prohibiting drugs really is like banning guns. When you ban guns, you conceivably reduce violence, but you definitely end up punishing an enormous number of innocent hobbyists - as well as the professionals who supply them. When you ban intoxicants, you conceivably reduce abuse, but you definitely end up punishing an enormous number of innocent hobbyists - as well as the professionals who supply them. It is easy to tar opponents of gun control as “soft on crime.” It is easy to tar opponents of prohibition as “soft on abuse.” But in a strange sense, both gun control and prohibition grow out of softness. A system with the moral courage to harshly, swiftly, and surely punish violence would have little need of gun control. A system with the moral courage to harshly, swiftly, and surely punish abusers for stealing, trespassing, vandalizing, and defiling would have little need of prohibition. In both cases, we haphazardly punish millions of innocents because we refuse to decisively punish thousands of clear-cut criminals.;943
Non-Rivalry for the Poor;https://betonit.substack.com/p/non-rivalry-for-the-poor;“Markets are great… if you have money to spend.” It’s one of the world’s top back-handed compliments. After conceding that markets treat the rich well, after conceding that markets even treat the middle-class well, it shines a sad spotlight on the plight of the poor. What do markets have to offer people with nothing to spend? Some easy responses: “Poor” is relative. Almost no one literally has “nothing to spend.” When the stores are bursting with consumer goods, a little cash goes a long way. This is even clearer when you remember that credit markets allow us to borrow against future earnings. They don’t have to be textbook “perfect credit markets” to be extremely helpful. Markets aren’t just places to spend money. They are places to make money, because markets make even modest talents highly productive. As I explain in Open Borders, that’s why billions globally want to move to the world’s most market-oriented countries. Market-oriented societies are richer, and richer societies are more charitable, at least measured by total giving. So even if you lack both current money and future earnings, you’re better-off in a market-oriented society. If you’ve ever been poor, however, you’ll notice that these talking points overlook a big strange fact about markets. Namely: Markets provide a long list of amazing products free of charge. To start: You can walk around almost any mall in the First World for free, enjoying free air conditioning in the summer, free heating in the winter, and a beautiful, clean, safe indoor city year-round. You can read unlimited books in almost any bookstore in the First World for free, often while seated in luxury furniture. Free wi-fi is often included. You can relax in almost any hotel lobby in the First World for free. Free wi-fi is, once again, often included. You can use this free wi-fi to consume the cornucopian cultural treasures of mankind on YouTube and hundreds of other streaming sites. While they do have paying customers, “freemium” is the default business model. The same goes for a great many videogames. You can spend piles of money, but you can also consume mass quantities for no money at all. What do all of these freebies have in common? In textbook terms, all of these gratis goods are non-rival, or nearly so. The extra cost of welcoming a penniless visitor to the mall to enjoy free air conditioning is roughly zero. Since demanding proof-of-funds alienates paying customers, extreme inclusivity is usually profit-maximizing. “I’m sorry, sir, but I have to ask you to leave”: Unless you’re blatantly homeless, no store employee will ever direct such words in your direction. You could argue that stores adopt “Come one, come all” policies because they fear discrimination lawsuits. But that’s a marginal factor at most. Even under current law, there’s nothing stopping businesses from imposing dress codes on their customers. Indeed, a few fancy restaurants still maintain such codes. But this is extraordinarily rare. Why? Because money’s money - and most patrons obliviously ignore one another. Until I became a professor, I rarely spent money on anything. I was poor, and I was cheap. But I still enjoyed access to a fine menu of free consumer goods. With the internet, that menu has grown by leaps and bounds. Yet instead of voicing gratitude, most of us take this bounty for granted. We should be grateful instead. Grateful for ourselves - and grateful for us all.;598
My Louise Perry Interview;https://betonit.substack.com/p/my-louise-perry-interview;"When you write a book, you never forget that a human being wrote it… because the human being is you. You know how much time and thought you put into your work. And if you’re honest, you realize that your book is less-than-perfect. In a word, flawed. As a result, your worst fear is not that critics will point out your mistakes, but that no one will deem you worthy of correction. When you review a book, in contrast, it’s easy to forget that another human being wrote it. You rarely ponder how much time and thought the author put into their work. What you’re hyper-conscious of as a reviewer, however, is all of the book’s perceived shortcomings. Most reviewers rarely even wonder, “Should I send the author a copy?” But if the thought strikes them, the natural response is: “What’s the point? After all my criticism, the author’s sure to hate me.” Counterpoint: Especially if you acknowledge their book’s merits, many authors will focus not on your specific criticisms, but the fact that you took the time to listen. Which is why, when I review, I try to remember to reach out to the author. It doesn’t always work, but it’s worth a try. When I wrote my review essay on Louise Perry’s The Case Against the Sexual Revolution, I tracked down her email and sent her a copy. I could easily understand why she might have just ignored me. But instead, Louise responded warmly, publicizing my review and asked me to speak on her Maiden Mother Matriarch podcast. Which turned out to be great fun. In the interview, Louise critically interviews me about Don’t Be a Feminist. Along the way, I wind up interviewing her about her book, too. Lots of common ground. By most measures, she is a more extreme feminist than my other feminist critics. But Louise admits that my definition of feminism fits actual usage well, and that most popular feminist complaints are one-sided. Our two big remaining disagreements, as I see them: While she grants that “Our society treats men more fairly than women” is debatable at best, Louise keeps hunting for some vestigial sense in which this claim is true. She keeps emphasizing that women have lower status than men, even though men plainly predominate at the bottom of society. I say that what she calls “status insults” are, like almost everything else, a two-way street: If we tend to negatively stereotype women as “childlike,” we also tend to negatively stereotype men as “beastlike.” For what it’s worth, both stereotypes check out in these two surveys, but the anti-male stereotype is stronger and more universal. Not to mention more insulting! Louise focuses on what could go wrong, while I focus on what could go right. Yes, it’s easy to find fault with both genders. But outside of standup comedy, finding fault with the opposite sex is deeply unconstructive. I say that social anxiety and loneliness are much bigger problems than romantic disappointment. Truly, “You’ve got to kiss a lot of frogs.” Furthermore, instead of blaming online dating and the mating market generally for their suffering, singles should focus on using online dating and the mating market thoughtfully. In her writing, Louise says that she feels good when single women tell her that she helped them turn down casual sex. What I’d like to hear, though, is that I helped someone find true love. Louise and I also cover my Selfish Reasons to Have More Kids and her forthcoming The Case for Having Kids, though I believe some of that discussion is for her paid subscribers only. Again, I maintain that she focuses far too much on the negatives of kids. My position continues to be: Raising kids is intrinsically easy; while many parents are stretched to their breaking point, the main reason is their stubbornly self-imposed painful parenting choices. Here’s the full interview. Thanks for being so cool, Louise!";679
Maximum Maximization: Takeovers and Profit Maxing;https://betonit.substack.com/p/maximum-maximization-takeovers-and;Close your eyes and visualize textbook perfect competition. In the short-run, Price=Marginal Cost. In the long-run, Price=Marginal Cost=Average Cost. Now look in a mirror speak to yourself like Gollum: “Perfect competition. So bright... so beautiful... ahh, precious...” Then ask yourself a little question in the same creepy voice: “What happens if a perfectly competitive firm fails to maximize profits?” The textbook answer, as you may recall, is that the firm suffers losses in the short-run, and goes bankrupt in the long-run. Under perfect competition, profit-maximization isn’t just one possible managerial motivation. It is the sole sustainable managerial motivation, because no one is rich enough to lose money forever. Does the same hold for monopoly as well? No. A monopoly, as long as P⩾AC, can stay in business indefinitely. Optimistically, this allows a monopolist to safely charge lower prices. Within limits, you can run your monopoly as a charity. Pessimistically, this allows a monopolist to safely waste inputs. Within limits, you can run your monopoly as a circus. Unless… your monopoly is publicly traded and hostile takeovers are fully legal. In this scenario, the CEO’s failure to maximize profits won’t bankrupt his company, but it will get the CEO fired. The mechanism is straightforward. Suppose your monopoly earns $50M annually. The interest rate is 5%, so your company is worth $1B total. The catch: If you maximize profits, the company will earn $100M. The first person who figures this out can simply buy 50.1% of the stock for $501M, fire the lackluster CEO, and replace him with someone who will maximize profits. The value of the raider’s shares skyrockets to $1.002B. If the raider buys up 100% of the stock, he does even better, netting a profit of $1B. Notice: This only works if firms are publicly traded. Unless I’m actually losing money, I can mismanage my sole proprietorship forever. Furthermore, it only works as long as hostile takeovers are unregulated. If I need the incumbent managers’ permission to buy their company, it might as well be a sole proprietorship. Sure, it is in their self-interest to sell, but their wiggle room is as expansive as their excess profits. Still, as long as we meet these two conditions - the company is publicly traded and hostile takeovers are unregulated - the results generalize broadly. They hold for every market structure where entry fails to drive price all the way down to average cost. Duopolies, oligopolies, whatever. Perfectly competitive managers face a choice between profit-maximization and bankruptcy. Other managers face a choice between profit-maximization and termination. “But hostile takeovers are heavily regulated!” you protest? You’re right. But who’s fault is that? Roughly speaking, the same people who lament that “Big corporations can do whatever they want.” If you dream of a world where top CEOs to run their companies with the same urgency as the humble wheat farmer, stop protecting them from corporate raiders. Raiders are the guardians of capitalist efficiency - the professionals who let even the captains of global industry know, “If you fail to maximize profits, you won’t fail for long.”;531
Caplan-Critical Links;https://betonit.substack.com/p/caplan-critical-links;Scott Alexander is deeply unhappy with my latest piece on mental illness. Although he doesn’t answer my rebuttals, he does diligently respond to various unrelated posts of mine, explaining why they must mean I am secretly admitting he was right all along. When I wrote about the scourge of witches stealing people’s penises, Caplan spun it as me secretly admitting he was right all along about mental illness. Sometimes I feel like this has gone a bit too far - when I announced I had gotten married, Caplan spun it as me secretly admitting he was right all along about mental illness. Let it be known to all that I am never secretly admitting Bryan Caplan is right about mental illness. There is no further need to speculate that I am doing this. If you want to know my position vis-a-vis Bryan Caplan and mental illness, you are welcome to read my four thousand word essay on the subject, Contra Contra Contra Caplan On Psych. You will notice that the title clearly telegraphs that it is about Bryan Caplan and mental illness, and that (if you count up the contras) I am against him. If that ever changes, rest assured I will telegraph it in something titled equally clearly. I’m a great admirer of Scott, but I can’t help but feel like he’s being unfair to me. Of course, I would think that, wouldn’t I? Maxim Lott, creator of Election Betting Odds, weighs in on my long-standing argument with Scott: Scott specified that the depression is due to hypothyroidism — which is typically caused “by the immune system attacking the thyroid gland and damaging it.” Surely the better way to model it is as part of the constraint. After all, the real person underneath their condition doesn’t want to sit in their room. It’s more that a broken body part is raising the cost of doing anything else. Modeled that way, if you draw the graphs, it become immediately clear that treating the hypothyroidism/depression will allow a person to rise to higher indifference/preference curves. This is in line with common sense. The condition here isn’t even inherently a “mental illness”, but rather just “illness” that had an impact on mental function. It should obviously be treated. But what if the depression were instead genetic, from birth? Where some abnormal piece of DNA caused a person’s brain to be wired in a way that produces low rewards for doing things? In that case, it becomes harder to justify considering depression as a constraint. Instead, it seems it really is inherent to the person — and has to be modeled as the person’s preferences — their indifference curve. For a depressed person, that’ll mean indifference curves that lean toward lying in bed and doing nothing. Matthew Adelstein says I’m wrong about the ethical treatment of animals: I think most people have the abstract ethical intuition that you shouldn’t inflict unimaginable torture on insects for the sake of minor benefits. They just generally don’t think that driving does that. If you knew that every time you drove your car, you consigned 100,000 insects to the microwave, you probably wouldn’t drive, or you’d at least think there’s some decent reason not to unless you really need to. The reason the conclusion is surprising is not that the moral claim is counterintuitive but that the claim about the world is counterintuitive. When the world is weird, obvious moral claims will produce weird results.;598
The Archives Are Open;https://betonit.substack.com/p/the-archives-are-open;As you may have noticed, all seventeen years worth my EconLog posts - over 5000 pieces altogether - have been added to the Bet On It archives. If reading my essay collections has whet your appetite for more classic Caplan, look no further. I strive to write for the ages rather than merely the issue of the day, so at least in my eyes, most of my old posts are still well worth reading. Credit where credit is due: I couldn’t have done any of this without the outstanding, can-do toil of David Spearman, who I met as a GMU econ Ph.D. student. He’s been the webmaster at Bet On It since a little bit before it moved to Substack. Indeed, I made the move partially on David’s advice. Astute guidance aside, David was a great help in making that transition as smooth as possible. He was also like a dog with a bone on this project, stubbornly working at the problems which came up until they were solved. Why was someone as good as David even available for my project? I don’t know. What I do know is that he is amazingly underplaced and on the job market. Professionally, David has a background in both economics (which is why I know him) and computer science (which why I asked him to take this project). This package makes him best suited for positions in data science, but he'd also love to hear about opportunities in data engineering, business intelligence, or as a staff economist. In addition to his Bet On It project management, he’s also done contract work as a data scientist at Stability AI (the creators of Stable Diffusion), and as an economist at Chmura Economics and Analytics, to name only two of his past roles.  Spearman is currently based in Salt Lake City, Utah, and would be most interested in positions which are either based there or full-time remote. But if you know of a role that would require him to relocate, he'd still like to hear about it. If you want a look at a recent portfolio project (or just want to see under the hood of how the EconLog posts ended up here), check out his GitHub. For more information on his professional background, see his LinkedIn. If you have an opportunity David should hear about, or want to see his resume, please reach out by email at dspearma@gmu.edu or connect with him on LinkedIn.  David really is an amazing worker, and will be a valuable asset to any team he joins. He’s a classic case of a market failure which is also a profit opportunity. Reach out now if you have a role for him! P.S. There are multiple issues with posting comments on my old posts. This is not David’s fault! Substack techs are still working on the problem. If and when they resolve the issue, I’ll post an update.;500
Woman: A Non-Circular Definition;https://betonit.substack.com/p/woman-a-non-circular-definition;I have several transgender friends. They’ve always been cool to me, and I sympathize with them. I also have several friends who have been deeply disturbed by their kids’ transgenderism. They have also always been cool to me, and I sympathize with them, too. All of these friends were on my mind as I watched Matt Walsh’s instantly infamous documentary, What Is a Woman? You can stream the full movie on Twitter here. Main reflections: This is a sublime, humane, and hilarious movie. Documentaries normally bore me, but this one had me on the edge of my seat. The people who condemn it as “offensive” or “transphobic” are childish fanatics. You may not like Walsh on his Twitter feed, but it’s hard not to like the Everyman he plays in this movie. You could accuse Walsh of hand-picking fools to interview. If you’re paying attention, however, you’ll see that the IQ of his hostile witnesses varies widely. Surgeon Marci Bowers and psychology professor Patrick Grzanka both struck me as extremely intelligent. They floundered with Walsh’s questions not because they’re dumb, but because they were hamstrung by their own dogmas - and fear of accidentally uttering thoughtcrimes on camera. “What is a woman?” This is the documentary’s central question, asked a hundred times over. None of Walsh’s hostile witnesses gives a non-circular response. But they totally could have, and remained 80% true to their faith! What they should have said: Literally, a woman is an adult human female. But to be nice, we extend honorary woman status to biological males with strong gender dysphoria. While this initially seems odd, we’re just treating the word “woman’ the same way we’ve long treated the word “parent.” Literally, a parent is a human who has sexually reproduced. But to be nice, we extend honorary parent status to people who adopt kids. Strictly speaking, they’re not “real parents.” But it’s rude to say so, and even ruder to make a big deal out of it. To see the strength of this response, imagine an alternate universe where no one has ever adopted a child. Then a handful of people start to do so, baffling the rest of society: “Face reality! You’re not a parent.” However, the number of adopters grows at a rapid rate, until they hit critical mass and start posting angry videos on social media screaming, “Adoptive parents are parents!” The reasonable position, again, is that while adoptive parents are not literally parents, it is nice to extend them honorary parent status. Are there any important disanalogies between transgenderism and adoptive parenthood? Sure. Most obviously, the social benefits of adoptive parenthood are plainly immense. Kids who would otherwise grow up in orphanages get devoted guardians to raise them. Adults who would otherwise be childless get cuddly kids to raise. What’s not to like? In contrast, and to be blunt, the social benefits of transgenderism are unclear. Yes, some gender dysphorics feel better. But others continue to feel pretty unhappy with their situation. And with rare exceptions, their families, especially their parents, are traumatized. “Overall social benefits”? To get a strong answer, you have to dismiss some of these preferences as fake, ephemeral, or illegitimate. How would such dismissal work? Preferences with a strong genetic basis are the opposite of fake or ephemeral. You don’t have to be Darwin to see why transgenderism scares parents: How are they supposed to get grandkids if you reject your biological gender? And while there’s strong evidence of genetic influence on sexual orientation, there is also strong evidence for a massive LGBT social contagion in decent decades. Which is not exactly the same thing as “fake” or “ephemeral,” but definitely “fake or ephemeral adjacent.” Research on “desistance,” moreover, is directly on point. Could we just dismiss some preferences as illegitimate? Sure, but then things get really complicated. Even preferences with a strong genetic basis can be totally illegitimate: Think of a fertility doctor who secretly fertilizes every egg with his own sperm. The main thing to realize is that this is a two-way street. The current elite view is that opposing your kids’ transgenderism is illegitimate. Walsh pretty clearly thinks that transgenderism itself is illegitimate. It’s hard to see how either side could convince the other. What is clear, however, is that “honorary” membership in a desired group is a positive incentive to join. Calling people who adopt “parents” encourages adoption. Calling men who identify as transgender “women” encourages transgenderism. Five years ago, I would have assumed that the latter effect was a rounding error, but I was totally wrong. The Gallup numbers really are shocking. In his interview with Marci Bowers, Walsh asked her about “transableism” or “apotemnophilia.” If a healthy person identifies as disabled, should surgeons treat them with elective amputations? Bowers scoffs, but the analogy is sound. What is the point of What Is a Woman? Though Walsh is studiously coy in his film, he’s upfront in his Twitter feed. As best as I can tell, he wants to forcibly shut down the whole medical transition industry for adults as well as kids. And if he accepted my proposed definition of womanhood, I’m confident that he’d strongly advocate denying “honorary woman” status to anyone. My own view: I’m happy to extend honorary woman status to anyone who asks nicely for it. I’m also happy to be friends with people who feel differently. At the same time, I find Walsh’s transableism analogy compelling. I just bite the bullet and affirm that adults have a right to amputate whatever they want, and surgeons have a right to sell such services. That said, if an adult friend asked my opinion of elective amputation, I would adamantly discourage them from doing it. I’d probably say much the same about hormonal treatments as well. Last, while I favor a strong presumption of deferring to parents’ judgment of what is best for their children, surgical or chemical treatment of minors’ gender dysphoria looks like child abuse to me. I am amazed that adults who are horrified by teens having sex, drinking alcohol, and using drugs would be blasé about elective amputation. And no, I don’t trust the judgment of the professionals who offer such services.;1062
"""Open Borders on Trial""";https://betonit.substack.com/p/open-borders-on-trial;FreedomFest is next week in Memphis, and I’ll be in attendance. My main event: I’m one of four expert witnesses at “Open Borders on Trial.” It’s a surreal event: Instead of yet another immigration debate, we’re having an old-school mock trial with famed skeptic Michael Shermer as the Judge, the one and only Larry Elder as the prosecutor, and Catherine Bernard as my defense attorney. The witnesses for the prosecution are National Review’s Jim Geraghty and the Epoch Times’ Jan Jekielek. The witnesses for the defense are myself and Jacob Hornberger of the Future of Freedom Foundation. In an Alice-in-Wonderland twist, the expert witnesses are also the defendants! I’ve never been an expert witness before, or even attended a trial for that matter, so I’m most curious to see how this plays out. Hope to see you in attendance in Memphis on July 14 at 5:30 PM. Earlier that morning, I’m also on the “Resurging Nationalism” panel moderated by Nick Gillespie. I’ll be sharing the stage with Norman Horn, as well as Rich Lowry, author of The Case for Nationalism. Here’s my half-minute case against nationalism. I’ll be around from Thursday afternoon to Saturday afternoon. If you see me, please introduce yourself. And if you’d like to organize a meet-up, please email me and I’ll post an addendum. P.S. Also happy to play games. I suspect that some of you attendees will be fellow nerds…;255
The Status of Women;https://betonit.substack.com/p/the-status-of-women;"Louise Perry, author of The Case Against the Sexual Revolution, reviewed my Don’t Be a Feminist last month. Or to be more precise, she wrote a detailed critique of the title essay. It’s definitely the best such critique so far. Here’s my point-by-point reply. Perry’s in blockquotes; I’m not. Any non-evil polemic against feminism must necessarily begin by defining feminism in a somewhat unorthodox manner, given that the definition of feminism that most of us will be familiar with—the definition offered by, for instance, Merriam Webster: “belief in and advocacy of the political, economic, and social equality of the sexes”—is so mild as to be agreeable to all but your more reactionary Saudi sheik, and even the Saudis are now permitting women to vote and drive.  This is an amazing and welcome concession. Verily, the “orthodox definition” is “so mild as to be agreeable to all but your more reactionary Saudi sheik.” Which strongly suggests that the orthodox definition is silly - a thinly-veiled effort to win a culture war by fiat. Yet how could this warped definition of feminism become orthodox? Via fear. Even though the all-but-your-more-reactionary-Saudi-sheik-inclusive definition violates common usage, feminists lash out if you refuse to play along. So Caplan offers an elegant alternative, one that he believes actually describes the meat of what twenty-first century Western feminism is all about: “the view that society generally treats men more fairly than women.” It’s a good definition in the sense that it identifies a point of disagreement between (at least some) feminists and (at least some) non-feminists. Whether one is willing to, as Caplan terms it, “sign on the dotted line” in response to such a statement does, I agree, tell us something meaningful.  A generous concession, but I humbly request more. The best data we have shows that this “point of disagreement” is in fact the central dispute between the vast majority of people who call themselves feminists and the vast majority of people who don’t. But Caplan’s is also a definition that invites people on both sides of the feminist aisle to whip out a scorecard and start adding up instances of gendered unfairness, as he promptly proceeds to do. To be clear, I’m hardly the person “whipping out the scorecard.” Feminists whipped out the scorecard in the 60s, and have kept it on public display ever since. Indeed, their “scorecard” is more of a jumbotron scoreboard. My value-added: I point out that the familiar score-keepers are stubbornly one-sided. If we’re going to keep score, let’s do so judiciously. You can see already that the scorecard is getting messy. It turns out that assessing the “fairness” of how “society” treats one half of the population compared with the other is difficult to judge, since there are so many different metrics one might use. Which, of course, is Caplan’s point: he offers up a definition of feminism, only to demolish its priors. Slightly overstated. A true “demolition” would show that men are clearly treated far less fairly than women. Which I also disbelieve. As the philosopher Alex Hill has pointed out, “Caplan wants the question of whether one ought to be a feminist to be empirically decidable.” If we accept this premise, then most of us will be forced to concede that men are not, always and everywhere, treated “more fairly than women” in an empirical sense. According to this definition, I am not a feminist.  Even a staunch feminist could, on my definition, concede that men are not “always and everywhere” treated more fairly than women. In the social sciences, exceptions abound. What I’d like readers to grant is that, on balance, men are treated about as fairly as women. Perry often sounds like she agrees, but does she? And yet I persist in describing myself as such, and not only because I enjoy confounding my critics’ expectations (although I do). I believe that there is some merit in using a looser definition of feminism that incorporates the recognition of substantial differences between the sexes. I assert that there are important ways in which men and women differ from one another, both physically and psychologically, and that these differences mean that the interests of the sexes are sometimes in tension.  So far, I’m in agreement. Though it’s strange to call this a “looser definition” of feminism, because the average feminist would probably have an especially high level of disagreement with these claims. Women are less likely to be found in positions of power. This is true for a variety of reasons, the most important of which is that it is women who give birth to babies, and women who tend to experience the strongest emotional pull towards being in close proximity to their young children. This basic biological fact means that all mothers will have to spend a short period of time out of the labour force when they give birth, and many mothers will want to extend that time further in order to care for their children. That’s a completely legitimate desire, but it inevitably impairs a woman’s career progression. True but misleading. As I said in my original essay, women are indeed underrepresented at the top of society. But they are also underrepresented at the bottom of society. Combine this with women’s higher average agreeableness (that is, the urge to put the interests of other people before one’s own), As I explain in my review of Perry’s The Case Against the Sexual Revolution, this ignores the other big personality gap between men and women: Women are more neurotic, which means they have a stronger tendency to feel and express sadness, anger, anxiety, and so on. What’s the net effect of women’s personalities on women’s self-advocacy? In theory, unclear. In practice, I say women self-advocate more, at least in modern Western societies. I suspect this is close to a human universal, but the data is sparse. and we end up with an important problem: the interests of women, particularly mothers, are less likely to be given voice in the corridors of power. Unless, of course, human beings - both male and female - have evolved to care more about female well-being and especially female suffering. Which they very likely have. Feminism—specifically, a feminism orientated towards maternity—is, I posit, the political movement that exists in order to counteract this problem.     Question: If our political system is “less likely to give voice to the interests of women,” shouldn’t it be easy to show that our society generally treats men more fairly than women? Yet Perry agrees that the evidence is very mixed. I maintain, rather, that feminism is the political movement that amplifies our natural tendency to care extra about female well-being and especially female suffering. Feminism transforms a common human emotion into a consistent social philosophy. A philosophy that is consistently unfair to men - and promotes antipathy and self-pity among women. I can imagine the response on the tip of Caplan’s tongue: that’s not how everyone else uses the term. Again, I agree. I concede that my definition is an eccentric one, even if I think it has merit, and that when most people describe themselves as “feminists” they’re thinking of something closer to Caplan’s “fairness” definition.  I agree that feminists want to advocate for women’s interests. But if they weren’t convinced that our society generally treats men more fairly than women, they wouldn’t be nearly as self-righteous. The belief that our society generally treats men more fairly than women is what makes makes the feminist movement a moralistic crusade rather than a pragmatic interest group. Except not quite. There’s a dimension to the real-world manifestation of feminism that is missed in the empirical “fairness” definition, and it’s a dimension that explains a great deal of how the feminist movement actually operates, including why my own brand of maternal feminism is so frequently marginalized. The magic ingredient is status… As a writer, Caplan is, for good and ill, somewhat blind to the issue of status. An odd claim. Does not my original essay repeatedly state that men are especially likely to have both high and low status? A consistent theme in his work is a general insensitivity to the more emotional side of human motivation.  When I ponder the world, I strive to avoid being emotional. Guilty as charged. But this hardly means I neglect of the power of human emotion. Quite the opposite. I maintain that unchecked emotionalism is the cause of most of the evil in the world. In Open Borders, for instance, Caplan makes a compelling case for the potential economic advantages of completely free migration (paired, necessarily, with a huge reduction in the size of Western welfare states). Yet there would be important social costs to the open borders future that Caplan envisages… It can also lead to a feeling—particularly among natives at the bottom of the socioeconomic heap—of being disrespected or even despised by those who applaud the arrival of cheap migrant labour. It could, though I see little sign of this actually happening. Cheap migrant workers normally have lower status than even low-skilled natives. Their status is so low that people publicly complain about them without looking over their shoulders first. Status-conscious natives should actually welcome low-status immigrants, because almost every native can tell himself, “At least I’m above them in the pecking order.” Status anxiety is not, however, irrational—at least, not always. Status often has a cash value, and by its very definition it has enormous social value. Our preoccupation with status is a product of our evolutionary history, during which the esteem of one’s peers was an important determinant of one’s access to mates and resources. To put it more bluntly: in conditions of scarcity, low-status people often died. As the descendants of people who managed to avoid this fate, we all have a built-in desire to be regarded as high status.  OK, though the intensity of this desire varies widely. Most humans are content to be average, and only a few are willing to work hard to attain very high status. On average, our desire to conform is much stronger than our desire to excel. This is highly relevant to feminism. In Don’t Be a Feminist, Caplan raises and rebuts a familiar feminist argument: Even if men and women spend equal amounts of time toiling, isn’t it unfair that men get to work so much outside the home, while women are stuck home taking care of kids? You could just as easily ask, “Isn’t it unfair that women get to take care of kids, while men are stuck working outside of the home?” It’s a good question, and it’s asked with a touching degree of sincerity. I should note here that Caplan is a highly attentive father of four: he homeschools his children, and he took on the night shifts when they were babies, including for a pair of twins. This may go some way towards explaining this blind spot. While I agree with him that taking care of kids is both joyful and enormously important, Caplan seems not to have noticed that his admirable tendency to hold childcare in high regard is a long way from being a universal position. Here’s what I’ve noticed: Almost no one holds childcare in the highest regard. A CEO, Nobel laureate, or senator can count on much more respect than a devoted mother of five. That said, almost everyone holds childcare in high regard. A devoted mother of even one child really can enjoy the respect of everyone who knows her without accomplishing anything else with her life. Nearly all of us adore our mothers, of course, and most people take a vaguely benevolent attitude towards “the fairer sex.” The “women are wonderful” effect is a phenomenon found in psychological research, which suggests that people associate more positive attributes with women than they do with men. If asked to choose between saving a male and female stranger, for instance, research participants will consistently opt to save the woman. True misogynists do exist, but they are rare.  Yes! At the same time, and seemingly counter-intuitively, women are consistently positioned slightly further down the pecking order in terms of status compared with men, as are the roles and preferences associated with women. No! Women’s status is not “further down the pecking order.” It is compressed. Women are less likely to have both very high and very low status. As Caplan himself observes, “childhood is much harder for the ‘sissy’ than the ‘tomboy’—and this disparity likely continues into adulthood.” Femininity is not only disfavoured in boys and men, but also very often in girls and women, who are liable to earn labels like “bimbo” and “airhead” for leaning into it.  Boys are punished more for gender non-conformity than girls. You could interpret this as a sign that “femininity is disfavored.” But isn’t the most natural explanation, again, Perry’s “women are wonderful” effect? A girl can be anything she wants to be, but a boy must measure up. A classic 1972 essay by the anthropologist Sherry Ortner asked, “Is Female to Male as Nature Is to Culture?” …I want to suggest an alternative: it is not that women are both blessed and damned by their association with nature, but rather by their association with children.  Human beings have a persistent habit of regarding women as childlike, both as a result of their smaller physiques, and also as a result of their role as mothers. While this is plausible, this is another two-way street. If human beings tend to regard women as childlike, they also tend to regard men as beastlike. Dirty, crude, rude, lustful, and violent. This [habit of regarding women as childlike] has its advantages. As Caplan notes, women—like children—are not conscripted in war or tasked with doing dangerous manual jobs, such as logging and waste disposal. Women also enjoy acts of benevolent sexism that are often invisible to the feminists who rage against male chauvinism, not recognizing that men are often far harsher to one another than women realize.  Not just “advantages.” Net advantages. Even in peacetime at my age, I’d happily trade the right to vote for immunity to conscription. For a prudent young man, this isn’t even a close call. But the status insult still stings, particularly for women of particularly high intelligence, or with particularly masculine temperaments, who highly resent the more-or-less implicit suggestion that they are intellectually childlike. This, I propose, is the true motivating force behind the feminist agitating that Caplan criticizes so strongly. I agree that this perceived “status insult” is a motivating force behind feminist agitating. But why think that it’s especially motivating compared to complaints about pay gaps, glass ceilings, sexual harassment, objectification, or violence against women? My response, in any case, is that both genders face a wide range of “status insults.” Focusing on status insults against women only makes sense if they’re especially unfair. Predictably, I deny that they are. And while you could decry all gender-based status insults as horrific, this seems silly. Because I am male, the world views me as beastlike, but I shrug it off. How? First, I try to stay numerate. The negative impact on my life is moderate. Nothing to lose sleep over. Second, I try to be understanding. The “men are beastlike” stereotype has a kernel of truth, and I occasionally act in a beastlike manner myself. Third, I try to preemptively defuse the insult that I am beastlike with good manners, proper grooming, and so on. If my daughter feels like society continues to treat her as “childlike” after adulthood, I would encourage her to copy my approach. Stay numerate, be understanding, and preemptively defuse the insult. So when Caplan asks why feminists don’t envy the women who “get to take care of kids, while men are stuck working outside of the home,” he is missing the point. For feminists intent on masculine status, this is like asking why junior staff who “get to fetch the coffee” envy the guy who is “stuck” as the big boss. Isn’t is obvious? asks the bewildered would-be girlboss. The woman’s role is just…. worse.  I agree that the “woman’s role is just worse” for some women. But plenty of women feel otherwise. And plenty of men with unpleasant and low-status jobs would prefer the woman’s role if they could get it. If my daughter ever becomes a bewildered would-be girlboss, I’ll give her two pieces of classic advice. First, if you want to lead, learn how to follow. Second, friendship rules the world. Instead of feeling aggrieved and voicing malcontent, demonstrate your value to the team and your appreciation of your teammates. Which is also good advice for everyone else, too.";2884
Build, Baby, Build: My Favorite Chapter 5 Pages;https://betonit.substack.com/p/build-baby-build-my-favorite-chapter-3b3;Here’s a sneak peak at chapter 5 of Build, Baby, Build: The Science and Ethics of Housing Regulation. The most intense objections to housing deregulation are often aesthetic: Development will look terrible! Especially when the status quo is beautiful as is, such aesthetic objections are pretty convincing. How, after all, can mere imagination compete with observation? The graphic novel format, however, literally lets me show readers what what could have been - or what the great Frédéric Bastiat famously called “the unseen.” Bastiat (1801-1850) died over a century before I was born, but that doesn’t stop the two of us from having a thrilling illustrated conversation about how gorgeous a free market in housing would look. Since his Economic Sophisms and Selected Essays on Political Economy were foundational in my early economic education, the chance to chat with the Master - even in imagination - was a quite a treat. If only France durably anointed Bastiat as its greatest intellectual, perhaps Paris could have lived up to its full potential!;170
One-Paragraph Book Reviews;https://betonit.substack.com/p/one-paragraph-book-reviews-f85;Here’s the next installment of One-Paragraph Book Reviews. The Stupidity of War: American Foreign Policy and the Case for Complacency by John Mueller. You may know Mueller for his numerate work on terrorism or his puckish Capitalism, Democracy, and Ralph’s Pretty Good Grocery. In The Stupidity of War, he shares his Big Picture on international relations. Contrary to simple-minded “realists,” Mueller argues that the costs of waging war are so high relative to the benefits that prudent people will virtually never want to fight. He makes a pretty strong case, but he’s much more effective at pointing out the absurd overconfidence of hawkish thinkers than actually proving his thesis. And he’s oddly overconfident himself: If people are stupid enough to fight stupid wars, why is Mueller so sure that the non-use of nuclear weapons since 1945 isn’t just a lucky streak? He should have limited himself to my common-sense case for pacifism, which simply holds that (a) you shouldn’t murder lots of innocent people (b) unless you know with high confidence that the benefits exceed the costs by a factor of five (c) which almost never happens due to the complexity of the world. Markets Against Modernity: Ecological Irrationality, Public and Private by Ryan Murphy. For me, this is probably the most flattering book ever published. SMU’s Ryan Murphy explicitly starts with The Myth of the Rational Voter and my theory of rational irrationality. His big critique: Lots of humans happily consume expensive irrationality. Some of his prime cases: anti-vaxxers, anti-GMOers, Do-It-Yourselfers, and locavores. The book was written right before Covid, which would have given him a bunch of mighty additional examples. The early Covid era definitely put me in a Murphyesque frame of mind, since the vast majority of Covid-scared people were very low-risk - and lots of parents kept their healthy kids masked and isolated for over a year. As time wore on, though, the cost of irrationality clearly kicked in: Almost all businesses reopened as soon as the law allowed, almost all parents sent their kids back to school as soon as they reopened, and a lot more people moved out of lockdown states than into lockdown states. Overall, this is a thrilling work of popular science, with a few odd asides on anarcho-capitalism, futarchy, and epistocracy. Great topics, but you can’t thoughtfully discuss radical reform proposals until you first convince reader that the status quo is radically dysfunctional. Homelessness is a Housing Problem: How Structural Factors Explain U.S. Patterns by Gregg Colburn and Clayton Aldern. In “The Panacea Policy,” my favorite chapter in Build, Baby, Build, I argue that housing deregulation makes a big dent in a wide range of social problems. But I initially left “homelessness” off the list of problems that deregulation would mitigate, because I thought the evidence was too weak. Homelessness is a Housing Problem changed my mind - and changed my book-in-progress. After examining a lot of different statistical predictors of homelessness, they find that absolute rent is probably the best. Granted, cheaper housing won’t house someone who spends 100% of his money on drugs. But you have to be really dysfunctional to be unable to make rent in Mississippi. Alas, after persuasively arguing that making housing really cheap drastically reduces homelessness, they back away from whole-heartedly supporting radical housing deregulation. Instead, they ignore their own central gripping result and switch to center-left boilerplate: Certainly, he hope that private developers will continue to build great amounts of market-rate housing, because these units can help to reduce overall pressure on the market. With the help of subsidies and tax credits, some of these developers may also contribute to the stock of housing that is affordable to more people. But when it comes to supplying housing for people with little or no income, the tool of the private market is not well-suited to the task. Neighborhood Defenders: Participatory Politics and America’s Housing Crisis by Katherine Einstein, David Glick, and Maxwell Palmer. This is one of the best empirical public choice books I’ve ever read - a clear-sighted exploration of the question, “Why exactly do local governments routinely strangle the housing industry?” Instead of just waving their hands and complaining about “NIMBYs,” Einstein, Glick, and Palmer (henceforth EGP) downloaded and analyzed the minutes - and often the full transcripts - of local planning and zoning boards of 97 towns and cities in Massachusetts. The big lesson: NIMBYism is not a hard-nosed effort to boost local housing prices. Instead, the typical NIMBY is a self-righteous crusader against ultra-petty local ills. If they only wanted money, you could buy them off and build. What the people who show up at meetings want, however, is to solve trivial problems regardless of the cost. A new building will block a view from the bike trail? Then the building shouldn’t exist! EGP show that even when construction is permissible de jure, activists use “death by a thousand cuts” to make prohibit construction de facto. Just keep demanding studies, requesting delays, and asking for further hearings until you whittle development plans down to nothingness. EGP are solidly pro-YIMBY, and are well-aware that grassroots democracy is doing great harm. But as Boston academics they can’t quite bring themselves to hail big business and denounce community activists, much less endorse the radical libertarian conclusion that free markets rule and democracy drools. Still, if you want an in-depth study of how democracy drools, this book is top-tier.;938
"""If You Have Time""";https://betonit.substack.com/p/if-you-have-time;"Here is another email from the Bet On It reader known on Twitter as SolarxPvP. Reprinted with his permission. I may reply when I return from Europe. If you have time, I have some more questions/suggestions unrelated to Market Urbanism. 1. You have a bunch of older posts on the GMU website that need more attention. Also, at least one of them, the post on healthcare, has glitched up such that strange question mark boxes have appeared throughout the article. I have to go to the Wayback Machine on archive.org to see versions that aren't like that. I think it's time that they are updated so a new audience can see them without these issues. Do you agree that it would be a good idea to republish them on your Substack? 2. You have written a critique of the welfare state and why our priors should expect it to create problems because of the irrationality of the poor. However, while the arguments you give are plausible on their face, you didn't give any hard data on how the welfare state has harmed poor people overall. Perhaps some act irrationally and assume being on welfare is better than getting a job, but most are helped by it. Further, do private charities not face the same problems where their aid is used by people afraid of losing it? Some better data on how much the poor are helped or harmed by the welfare state is needed. I think happiness data on having a job might be relevant too. I thought of this because someone posted this tweet with data that says that welfare helps the poor. Also, I'd like to see if there's any good empirical evidence that welfare hurts while private charity helps, and if there is a good reason why this is the case. 3.  I have an objection to your ideas on labor economics most clearly expressed in ""The Joy of Market Clearing Wages"" that I don't think you've addressed yet. You say that approximately after subsistence-level wages, happiness doesn't go up too much. However, you never say when this exact level is. An extra dollar an hour matters more to someone making 7.25$ an hour than to someone making 50$ an hour. The question is how much, and you never really made clear whether giving an extra dollar amount to people increases happiness more overall than the unemployment effects. Wouldn't more people be affected positively by a minimum wage increase than the unemployment effect from the minimum wage? I think the case can be made for this from the empirical literature on the effects of the minimum wage on unemployment being mixed.  4. Building on that, I have an objection to your arguments against Scott Alexander on the bargaining power of workers vs. employers: diminishing marginal utility. Businesses and employers are richer than their employees the vast majority of the time. It seems like employers can afford to not have a worker more than a worker can afford to not have a job because employers have a larger financial safety net. Given that, how do employers not have more bargaining power over their employees? 5. Have you ever considered making a ""reading"" chart of sorts for the Huemer/Caplan style approach to libertarianism? I'm talking about something like this: Except more focused on ""common sense libertarianism"" as a philosophy. It could include regular articles and the like rather than just books. Also, it could include readings on specific topics. One section could be for general philosophy where books like ""The Problem of Political Authority"" would be, another would include books on general economics like ""Unbeatable"" when it releases, and another would include readings on specific issues like ""Fossil Future"" and papers like Huemer's ""Is There a Right to Own a Gun?"" Each part could also include some easily digestible blog articles and interviews to get someone started. This would help as a reference guide for someone trying to read the best arguments from our side.  6. Have you ever considered collaborating with Huemer to write a book defending Huemerian-style libertarianism against other forms of libertarianism? It could defend Huemerian ways of arriving at the truth as being better than Rothbardian, Hoppean, Objectivist, and utilitarian ways while also being better at rhetoric. You could focus on the economic part by arguing against Austrian economics. I know this is a pretty big project idea, but I thought it was worth it to share. It would help establish ""Huemerian"" libertarianism as a bigger school of thought and even change some minds.";776

When Is Consent Not Consent? A Flow Chart;https://betonit.substack.com/p/when-is-consent-not-consent-a-flow;Louise Perry’s The Case Against the Sexual Revolution faults feminists for accepting, even glorifying, all consensual sex. Though I’m a critic of the movement, this strikes me as a bizarre misinterpretation of feminism. Yes, feminists use the word “consent” a great deal. Many will even say, “Anything goes, as long as it’s consensual.” But their primary goal is not to stand up for consensual sex, but to stand against much apparently consensual sex for being… non-consensual. How? Start with apparently consensual sex, then ask all of the following questions. Question #1: Was the consent affirmative? I.e., did the parties actually pronounce words like “Yes” or “Hell yeah!” without irony? Question #2: Was the affirmative consent stepwise? I.e., did the parties repeatedly obtain affirmative consent as the level of intimacy escalated? Question #3: Was the consent free of pressure? I.e., did either party feel like there would be negative consequences of refusing consent? Question #4: Was there a power balance between the parties? I.e., did neither party have relevant social status noticeably exceeding the other? In flow chart form: If you answer No to any of these questions then, contra Perry, most feminists are totally open to harsh condemnation. And guess what? Answering “yes” to all four questions is hard. At least 99% of apparently consensual sex falls short. Basic facts: Only fanatics habitually request affirmative consent, because that’s for robots. Even fanatics rarely request stepwise affirmative consent, because there’s a limit to what robots will do. Seriously, this is the chastity belt version of Zeno’s paradox, because you can always subdivide a step into smaller steps. There is always pressure in human relations. Always! “I won’t like you as much unless you do what I want,” though rarely declared, is omnipresent. And if you care about another person, this omnipresent threat easily becomes scary and saddening. “Power” is rarely balanced, even approximately. Suppose two people’s official job titles are the same. They’ll still be noticeably unequal in at least one of the following: income, looks, intelligence, family support, and social connections. In any case, to bluntly state an ugly truth, one of the main things people find attractive in a partner is precisely higher status than their own! You tell your friend, “She’s out of your league” to warn him that he’ll be rejected, not to convince him that he wouldn’t want to be accepted. Lest you accuse me of attacking a straw man, I’m not claiming that feminists reliably condemn all sex that falls short of these impossibly high standards. I’m claiming, rather, that feminists are open to harsh condemnation if and when someone (especially a woman) vocally complains after the fact. And if the violation of these standards is strong enough (say, sex between a worker and her boss, or a rich old guy with a college student), feminists assume the worst. The true feminist slogan is therefore not “Anything goes!” but “Everything is suspect!” I suppose that’s sex-positive compared to “All pre-marital sex is wrong.” But in absolute terms, it’s almost medieval.;528
The Szaszian Fork: Another Reply to Scott Alexander on Mental Illness;https://betonit.substack.com/p/the-szaszian-fork-another-reply-to;"I have a long-running debate with Scott Alexander about mental illness. I take the Szaszian view that most so-called “mental illnesses” are not illnesses at all, but socially disapproved preferences. Scott, a professional psychiatrist, says I’m deeply in error. I say Scott’s great, but deeply in error. He replies that I’m the one deeply in error. I say his marital search algorithm shows I was right all along. Neither of us has convinced the other. Our argument is wide-ranging, but one sticking point is the fact that being gay used to officially be a mental illness, and now it’s not. Scott: The psychiatric profession will never live down the thing about homosexuality; I fully expect that in 5000 AD someone will still be complaining that we can’t stigmatize entities infected with superintelligent self-replicating memetic viruses, because DSM-II listed homosexuality as a psychiatric disease. Me: Question for Scott: According to you, what do we learn about psychiatry from “the thing about homosexuality”?  Do we simply learn that psychiatrists made a mistake?  If so, what precisely was their mistake?  After all, once you reject the distinction between preference and constraint for “anything more complicated than which brand of shampoo to buy,” why shouldn’t you label same-sex attraction as a “constraint” no different from paralysis? Even today I bet that most gay teens would take a pill that permanently “cured” their same-sex attraction.  Does that show they’re sick?  If not, why not? Scott’s original response seems uncharacteristically evasive: We want some criteria that let us call shingles a disease, but don’t let us call “being thin but wanting to be even thinner” a disease. Unfortunately, there is no perfect solution to this problem. People have wanted perfect solutions to definitional questions ever since Plato defined man as “a featherless biped”, and it’s never worked. This January, however, Scott wrote a piece that makes it sound like I’ve finally convinced him. Not just on being gay, but on everything. His title says it all: “You Don't Want A Purely Biological, Apolitical Taxonomy Of Mental Disorders.” Why not? Because calling a condition a “mental illness” is, as Szasz taught, rhetorical trickery. Scott: We have to classify pedophilia as a mental illness, because we want insurance to pay for treatment. If someone shows up at a psychiatrist saying “Help, I feel an urge to molest children, is there anything you can do to get rid of that urge or prevent me from acting on it?”, I definitely want insurance to pay for this person’s treatment. Therefore, pedophilia “is” “a” “mental” “illness”, and no sophisticated categorization algorithm will ever convince me otherwise. Am I putting my words into Scott’s mouth? Amazingly, no. Here’s Scott again: When the DSM is political, it’s not (just) because the authors are ideologues and want to go around stigmatizing people they don’t like. It’s because “is X a mental disorder or not?” is scientifically meaningless but politically very important.* As Eric Cartman would exclaim, “That’s what I say!” “That’s what I say!” If you follow Scott’s last link, however, you’ll discover that his actual position is more nuanced. So we haven’t yet reached a meeting of our minds: ""Disease"", like ""blegg"", suggests that certain characteristics always come together. A rough sketch of some of the characteristics we expect in a disease might include: 1. Something caused by the sorts of thing you study in biology: proteins, bacteria, ions, viruses, genes. 2. Something involuntary and completely immune to the operations of free will 3. Something rare; the vast majority of people don't have it 4. Something unpleasant; when you have it, you want to get rid of it 5. Something discrete; a graph would show two widely separate populations, one with the disease and one without, and not a normal distribution. 6. Something commonly treated with science-y interventions like chemicals and radiation. Scott’s even got a diagram that lets me pinpoint our disagreement in his own framework: Scott’s Diagram on Defining Disease Where do I pinpoint our disagreement? I maintain that no preference is a disease. No matter how bizarre or horrible (or common or wonderful). Diseases are constraints, not preferences. How can we tell the difference? Preferences are voluntary; constraints aren’t. “I did it because I wanted to” means voluntary. “I did it because I had to” means involuntary. OK, how do we know what’s “voluntary” - especially in a world where people excuse bad behavior by claiming they “had no choice”? Simple: If any incentive in the universe makes you stop, you must have been able to stop all along. Incentives matter implies voluntariness implies preference implies non-disease.* That’s my Gun-to-the-Head Test. Szaszian dogma? I call it common sense. But if you won’t bite my bullet, Emil Kirkegaard’s critique of Scott serves an alternate bullet for your culinary pleasure: Scott doesn't want to bite the bullet and say that DSM unclassifying homosexuality was a mistake, so he has to go on complicating things about how classifications are also political, as they unlock monetary support for treatment…. I submit this is not a very, well, scientific approach. The correct solution is to recognize that homosexuality is a mental illness for the obvious reasons. Emil’s “obvious reasons”: Homosexuality is evolutionarily maladaptive. “From an evolutionary perspective, humans are a sexually reproducing species, so sexuality should -- must -- be targeted at the opposite sex. But furthermore, it should be targeting the right age too. So since female fertility is strongly age-dependent, men's targeting must be primarily of fecund females, so age 15-45 or so. Female targeting can be less age dependent, but should at least be 15+ (and that's what we see). Thus, if someone is targeting persons outside of the adaptive age, that is a disorder of sorts.” Homosexuality correlates with many other heritable mental illnesses. “The most important fact about mental illness is that all the various diagnoses tend to occur together, called comorbidity. This is why one can speak of mental illness overall as a kind of trait, which we call general psychopathology, or P factor. Homosexuality relates positively to most mental problems, and for genetic reasons too.” The stigma explanation for comorbidity is indefensible. “Stigma against homosexuals has decreased markedly in the last couple of decades, and yet homosexuals still show markedly elevated rates of mental problems. If this was caused by stigma, it should have declined rapidly, ergo, it is not caused by stigma.” Contrary to what you’ve heard, homosexuality is treatable: “So 14 studies with a mean sample size of 25, and they used something like 14 different designs and maybe half that different measures. Ripe for publication bias and p-hacking. Still, they managed to obtain an absurdly (?) large mean effect size of 0.89 d. And some of the studies used outcomes that are not so obviously stupid such as penile volume measures. I mean, I was expecting them to just rely on self-reported sexual behavior or thoughts following extended talks with priest-therapists. It would be easy to see how social desirability bias could distort such results. So maybe, just maybe, it isn't as obviously stupid as it sounds. After all, if homosexuality can rapidly increase in the population, this suggests it can be environmentally induced, and in that case, maybe also cured (see also this post by George Francis).” If you’re paying attention, you know that I totally disagree with Emil. And you know why. To repeat: Preferences can’t be diseases! Not alcoholism, not idleness, not the urge to commit murder, and not your sexual preferences. Indeed, by Emil’s logic, what preferences aren’t diseases?! Being a nun or priest is evolutionarily maladaptive; it probably correlates with multiple neurotic issues even when stigma is low; and you could probably “treat” this genetically destructive occupational choice in a hundred different ways. For that matter, the same probably goes for the preference of doing anything other than maximizing your surviving offspring. Spending money on vacations instead of kids is evolutionarily maladaptive; it probably correlates with multiple neurotic issues even when stigma is low; and you could probably “treat” this genetically destructive spending in a hundred different ways. The punchline: Although Scott now seems a lot closer to me than I realized, he’s clinging to an unstable intermediate position on mental illness. Emil’s position may fill you with rage, but it’s logically consistent. So is mine. Choose one, because as Emil’s namesake Søren Kierkegaard titled his most famous book, it’s Either/Or. * Yes, I person could simply have an infinitely strong preference, which would still be voluntary. Incentives don’t matter does not imply involuntariness, though it leaves the possibility open.";1491
Do Ten Times as Much;https://betonit.substack.com/p/do-ten-times-as-much;"Almost no one learns how to speak a foreign language very well in school. By the numbers, it’s tempting to declare, “Learning a foreign language is impossible.” But that’s plainly false. Going from zero to fluency is ultra-rare, but I’ve seen it happen. How does fluency happen? First and foremost, people who attain fluency practice a lot more than the typical foreign language student. “A lot” doesn’t mean 10% more, 25% more, or even 100% more. People who attain fluency practice about ten times as much as the typical person who is officially “learning a foreign language.” Sure, the quality of practice matters, too; immersion is the best method of foreign language acquisition. But unless you’re willing to give ten times the normal level of effort, fluency is basically a daydream. When I see the contrast between people who succeed and fail, I generally witness a similar gap in effort. During my eight years in college, I spent many thousands of hours reading about economics, politics, and philosophy. Since high school, I’ve spent over ten thousand hours writing. When young people ask me, “How can I be like you?“ my first thought is, again, do ten times as much. Ten times as much of what, exactly? The answer is usually: Whatever you already think the crucial ingredient is. “Why can’t I get ahead in my career? I strive to study and emulate my role models.” Great idea; you just need to multiply your effort by a factor a ten. “How can I save my marriage? I’m really trying to make my spouse happy.” Again, great idea. You just need to multiply your effort by a factor of ten. “Five minutes? You want five fucking minutes, Denny? You know what? I haven't got five fucking minutes!” (The Room, 2003) Incredulity is tempting. In the spirit of Chris-R in The Room, you may object, “Ten times as much? You want ten times as much, Bryan? You know what? I haven’t got ten times as much!” But my advice is usually far more practical than it sounds, because most people who “want to succeed” barely lift a finger most of the time. Saying ten times as many kind words to your friends is easy in a world whether most people only say two or three such sentences weekly. Cold emailing ten times as many successful people in your field for advice is easy in a world where most people do so once in a lifetime. Never underestimate your fellow man’s lack of initiative. Take parenting. Most readers summarize my Selfish Reasons to Have More Kids as “Parenting doesn’t matter.” But that is only one possible interpretation of the twin and adoption data. The data is also consistent, however, with the theory that most parents are barely trying to get results - at least on many relevant margins. I pondered this in depth before I started homeschooling my kids. I’m always stunned by all the economists who fail to teach their kids about supply-and-demand. All my kids know about these holy diagrams. What’s the difference between their kids and mine? I did ten times as much. Teach your children this holy diagram! Still, once you internalize the “Do ten times as much” norm, you are in for some soul-searching. If you want to learn a foreign language, you need to budget about two thousand hours. If you want to master a technical subject, you need to budget about five thousand hours. If you want your kids to be pious Orthodox Jews, move to an Orthodox neighborhood, send them to Orthodox schools, deny them internet, and don’t let them make friends with outsiders. Either that, or admit that you’ve got higher priorities. No one succeeds at everything. If you’re not willing to do ten times as much, just level with yourself: “I’ve got better things to do than learn a foreign language.” “I’ve got better things to do than become a great economist.” “I’ve rather raise my kids in the modern world than be a family of earnest Orthodox Jews.” If you take all of the time you dabble away in a hundred quixotic ways and concentrate it on two or three goals you truly prize, you’ll probably succeed at what you value the most. Pick your battles, friends. And wherever do you choose to fight, do ten times as much.";751
Market Urbanism: Another Panacea;https://betonit.substack.com/p/market-urbanism-another-panacea;"The Twitter personality known as SolarxPvP sent me a thoughtful email on market urbanism. I may reply when I return from Europe. Reprinted with his permission. I found this tweet you made recently, and I'm happy to see that market urbanism is on your radar.  It needs far more attention from libertarians. To show you why, I will introduce you to Not Just Bikes, a fantastic YouTube channel I found earlier this year that opened my eyes to the problems of the modern city. He convinced me that poor urban design is the cause of countless problems and that good urban design is more than just YIMBYism. But before that, let me give you a brief primer on urbanism in case you are not aware. The primary problem with current cities is that they are extremely car-centric. We don't realize this because it's just everyday life and we assume that cars make transportation easier and more convenient, but this is false. Car-centric designs are so bad that they make driving worse. The Netherlands, the model country on the YouTube channel, is one of the best places to drive in the world despite its walkable urban design as he has persuasively argued.  Remember this fact: cities and their infrastructure are government funded and planned. The car-centric model was developed because the government mass-funded roads to be built for cars; and the government, as it does for everything, has terrible incentives. So it did not do this because it was more efficient to be car-centric and respond to market demand but because of public choice incentives.  Like YIMBYism, there are many modern social problems that walkable cities provide at least partial solutions. Here are a few: 1. Fewer car crashes. Less need for cars every day means fewer cars. Therefore, a car-independent city has fewer crashes. Driving is one of the most dangerous activities we do every day, and more people will live longer and more prosperous lives without crashes in car-independent cities. Also, better road design means fewer crashes for the cars that are still on the road. 2. Fewer people will need to pay for cars. Aside from housing, cars are the most expensive things most people pay for. You no longer will need a car for Mom and Dad and all the teenagers in the house. Many people will just use bikes or public transport. In the Netherlands, bikes are specially designed for commuting and comfort unlike the sports bikes in the U.S. There are also specialized bikes, such as cargo bikes, to carry groceries and children. They can be expensive but are much less expensive than cars. Public transportation is also far more reliable and more comfortable (especially in Switzerland, a country that outdoes even the Netherlands on this point). Imagine the extra disposable income from not having to pay NIMBY prices or pay for a car! Being poor would be much easier. 3. Obesity. Walking and biking are more exercise-friendly than cars. I don't think this needs much explanation. 4. Socialization. Many people reminisce about college. College campuses are much more walkable than normal towns and cities, so people are walking around and seeing their friends every day. In car-centric cities, people are trapped in a box on asphalt. You can easily walk to your friends' dorm rooms or run into your friend outside of the cafe. You can smile and wave at people on your commute. Little things like that brighten people's day. Want to see your friends in a walkable city? Just walk down the street to the corner bar or cafe in a minute. Make new friends. 5. Childhood and disability independence. In The Netherlands, it's common for kids to bike or walk everywhere on their own. The lack of cars and the presence of watching eyes everywhere of people they trust and see every day likely makes parents feel safer letting their children bike to school and the park. This gives children good memories. People are watching other people instead of other cars. The older and disabled are also given more independence. They don't have to be driven everywhere by family, rely on their sight not getting them in a car accident, or rely on their sight to not accidentally walk in front of a car. 6. Traffic and noise pollution. ""Traffic. So. Much. Traffic,"" they say. In walkable cities, it's all gone! Streets are full of people and bikes moving along at a nice pace and can transport as many people as an interstate or multilane road without the congestion. In one of his videos (I don't remember which one specifically), he shows a poll comparing how much people missed commuting during COVID when everyone was stuck in their houses. Walkers missed their commute the most, drivers missed their commute the least, and people who took trains were somewhere in between. Also, car-free is shorter overall. My guess is this is part of the reason Europeans are happier than Americans: they can walk more. In a Not Just Bikes video, he shows how quiet Amsterdam can get compared to other cities. At one point, he measured the decibel levels as being the level of a library! People and bikes are much quieter than wheel friction and horns. Some studies show that noise pollution makes people much less happy. 7. Aesthetics. People often complain that American cities and suburbs are bland, boring, and samey. Cities in the Netherlands are not and are pretty. American cities are ugly asphalt oceans that people ignore when driving to work and looking at the road, but people in the Netherlands are walking everywhere and looking at the scenery around them, so things are better designed.  8. Crime. This is one I thought of myself. Instead of having to worry about enforcing traffic laws as much, police could patrol communities looking for violent and property crimes. In the U.S. where gun laws are laxer, people would be carrying while walking around as well, so if something happens, an armed person would be available for quick assistance. They could also defend themselves easily. Also, if more developed areas have less crime as you argued in your panacea lecture on YIMBYism, I imagine prettier neighborhoods would have the same effect! 9. The Environment. Although Alex Epstein has convinced me that carbon emissions are overhated, it is another way to convince people of it. There will be fewer cars and therefore fewer emissions.  The videos Not Just Bikes makes describe many of these benefits. I encourage you to watch many of his videos, but here's a sampling of them to get an idea of the arguments for urbanism. An excellently produced channel trailer that accurately depicts how different you will see the world. ""There's Something Wrong With Suburbia (The Orange Pill)"" A video about ""stroads,"" the basis of American road design that makes it awful.  ""Stroads are Ugly, Expensive, and Dangerous (and they're everywhere) [ST05]"" For this next one, the title explains itself. ""Cities Aren't Loud: Cars Are Loud"" The independence that kids get in The Netherlands, and how that makes it better. ""Why We Won't Raise Our Kids in Suburbia"" A car-free area in Toronto that is in high demand. I think it provides evidence that neighborhoods would become walkable if left to the free market due to their higher demand. Car-centric infrastructure is incredibly expensive and wasteful too, and I believe the market would not build wasteful infrastructure as much. I recommend going through his most popular videos (click the dropdown menu and select the most popular option) and watching a lot of them. You'll learn much more than what I have shared here and you'll see much of the great city design in action - including some YIMBY videos. I haven't watched all of his videos, but I've watched a good bit of them, and they have significantly changed my perspective. I highly suggest doing so. The main problem with most urbanists - including Not Just Bikes who I am sure is on the left - is that they are not libertarians. As you have noted, there is the market urbanist movement. But it gets little attention. Scott Beyer of the Market Urbanism Report is the name I see most often, and market urbanists such as him have been featured in Reason videos. Nevertheless, if you search for Beyer on YouTube, his videos have very few views. There are two decent-sized Twitter accounts about market urbanism, one run by Beyer's website at marketurbanismreport.com and the other run by marketurbanism.com. That's it. The movement deserves more attention from libertarians and urbanists. It's important we prove we don't need the government, even the Dutch one, to make cities beautiful. Public choice must get out of the way. Beyer's book ""Market Urbanism: A Vision for Free-Market Cities"" is the main book on the movement from what I am aware. He is on a journey traveling around the United States and the world to see how cities work to inform his arguments. There is also the book ""The Voluntary City"" edited by Alex Tabarrok, David T. Beito, and Peter Gordon, but I don't know if it tackles the same issues much. Both of the websites I've listed (marketurbanism.com and marketurbanismreport.com) have more information about market urbanism.  I think a review of Beyer's book on your blog would be more than worth it to promote the movement. I also want to see if you think urbanism under an anarcho-capitalist society would be practical, and I'd like to see how much your views have changed on society. If you like his book and believe it to be sufficient, perhaps you could one day write another graphic novel on urbanism. If you think you can do better, perhaps you could write a book on Market Urbanism one day. I can't wait to see what you think!";1687
Truth Serum: The Other Ehrlich Bets;https://betonit.substack.com/p/truth-serum-the-other-ehrlich-bets;"We’ve all heard about the Ehrlich-Simon bet. Simon the cornucopian bet that resources would get cheaper, Ehrlich the doomsayer bet that they would get pricier, and Simon crushed him. There’s a whole book on it. What you probably don’t know, however, is that in 1995, Paul Ehrlich and Steve Schneider proposed a long list of new bets for Simon - and that Simon refused them all. Why did Simon refuse? Critics naturally hold that Simon lacked the courage of his convictions. But Simon’s story was that the new bets weren’t really about human well-being: Let me characterize their offer as follows. I predict, and this is for real, that the average performances in the next Olympics will be better than those in the last Olympics. On average, the performances have gotten better, Olympics to Olympics, for a variety of reasons. What Ehrlich and others say is that they don't want to bet on athletic performances, they want to bet on the conditions of the track, or the weather, or the officials, or any other such indirect measure. As a betting man myself, I maintain that anyone can offer betting terms so lop-sided that no sensible opponent will agree to bet. The epistemic force of a bet comes from mutual consent: If both sides agree ex ante that a measure counts, then it’s comical/pathetic for the loser to ex post declare, “I really won.” So even though I read about the proposed followup bets back in 1995, I hadn’t really given them a second thought since. Until… I discovered that my new colleague Vincent Geloso (together with Pierre Desroches and Joanna Szurmak) had a two-part 2021 paper in Social Science Quarterly analyzing what would have happened if Simon had opted for the rematch. The piece is called “Care to Wager Again? An Appraisal of Paul Ehrlich’s Counterbet Offer to Julian Simon.” Part 1 is “Outcomes”; Part 2 is “Critical Analysis.” What do Desroches, Geloso, and Szurmak (DGS) discover? First, they review the 15 bets Ehrlich and Schneider offered. If you ever needed proof that betting makes people more rational, look no further. No glimmer of Ehrlich’s infamous hyperbole remains, just 15 mild-mannered claims. Note further that a few of these predictions are precisely what you’d expect if human progress continues! Wealthy humans consume near-zero firewood. Unless progress is amazingly uniform, you’d expect the richest 10% to pull away from the poorest 10%. The world’s poorest people are stuck in true hellholes - and even if their government lets them flee, no other country on Earth will take them. Oceanic fisheries are a commons, so in the absence of privatization, you’d expect them to be depleted as demand grows - but more than replaced by fishing farming. That said, Part 1 of DGS just takes the 15 bets at face value and forges on to the evaluation stage. Initial verdict: Ehrlich and Schneider chose a mixture of bets they could win and bets that are hard to measure. Bottom line for Part 1: Simon wins on only one indicator while Ehrlich and Schneider win on eleven. There is too much uncertainty to adjudicate a winner for three claims. Table 5 also includes a column on measurement quality. The use of the word “problematic” in this column refers to the selection and quality of proxy data when the terms used by Ehrlich and Schneider did not match clearly defined or measured quantities in the scientific literature. We also did not refrain from declaring Ehrlich and Schneider winners on their own terms when simple logic dictated the outcome even in the absence of suitable indicators. For instance, while “fertile cropland” is not an indicator found in the technical literature, a significant increase in population that occurred between 1994 and 2004 must mean that less farmland would be available per capita at the end of the time period even if cropland were to be created through, for instance, the draining of wetlands and the conversion of pasturelands. On their own terms then, Ehrlich and Schneider can be declared the winners of this wager. (emphasis mine) In Part 2, DGS start by extending the bet resolution year from 1994 to the most recent data. Now Simon wins a few more: Simon would win three claims, with trends in two more clearly favoring his perspective, while Ehrlich and Schneider win nine. Three indicators remain uncertain. The word “problematic” refers to the use of proxy data when the concepts used by Ehrlich and Schneider did not have equivalents in the literature, or else when they can hardly be considered as supportive of the Ehrlich–Schneider worldview (e.g., land per capita). Take AIDS deaths. Ehrlich and Schneider were right to forecast a large global rise - but neglected to predict a subsequent crash. DGS then review Simon’s original reservations in detail. Ehrlich and Schneider picked bets that Ehrlich, Schneider, and Simon should all expect Simon to lose… if Simon were right about the world! Simon offered three reasons for his rejection the second bet offer: the role of government policy; a personal version of the process more widely known as the environmental Kuznets curve; and the preference for direct measures of human welfare. The last of these reasons explains the indicators on which Simon proposed to wager a counterbet. On government policy: In the 1980 bet, Simon insisted on betting on commodities that were not subjected to important government interventions (e.g., price control, quotas, trade, or production restrictions) to reflect his view that creative individuals in free markets are able to produce solutions to deal with environmental problems. Implicit in this outlook is the notion that government policies can hinder the ability of markets to provide environmental solutions. Thus environmental problems could be—as Simon often pointed out—caused by governments meddling with markets or by governments failing to secure private property rights. DGS then remind us that Simon had a counter-offer to Ehrlich and Schneider’s counter-offer. Simon picked bets that Ehrlich, Schneider, and Simon should all expect Simon to win if Simon were right about the world. And in hindsight, win he did: When he rejected Ehrlich and Schneider’s offer, Simon stated he would rather use “measures of actual welfare, rather than intermediate conditions.” Without formally proposing a new bet, Simon (n.d.) suggested some indicators on which he would be willing to wager: “mortality and morbidity,” “life expectancy,” “future calorie intake, food prices, or food output,” “fish consumption which includes (…) fish farming” and “skin cancer death” (to reflect ozone-related problems). Shifting to these indicators gives Simon’s a clear win. For example, in Table 2 we already showed that the overall food supply (measured in calories per capita) has increased over the time window of the bet, which explains why global indicators of malnutrition have shown marked improvements in recent decades (Roser and Ritchie, 2013). Life expectancy at birth rose from 66.1 years in 1994 to 68.7 in 2004 and 72.6 in 2018 (World Bank, 2020). When wild catch and aquaculture fisheries are added to each other, fish consumption per capita increased 7 percent from 1994 to 2004 and a further 17 percent to 2015 (FAO, 2020b). Simon would only lose with regard to one of his proposed indicators: skin cancer rates which, when age-standardized, have increased mildly since 1995 (IHME, 2020). DGS charmingly conclude their two-part article by bluntly telling us their own conclusion: The fact that Ehrlich and Schneider’s own choice of indicators yielded mixed results in the long run, coupled with the fact that Simon’s preferred indicators of direct human welfare yielded largely favorable outcomes is, in our opinion, sufficient to claim that Simon’s optimistic perspective was once again largely validated. If I were a fourth co-author, though, I would have insisted on a much deeper and broader lesson: Betting is so epistemically purifying that even the prospect of betting dramatically raises the quality of thought. Betting is a Truth Serum potent enough to make even notorious doomsayers temporarily reasonable. If the world of ideas took my Betting Norm to heart, to quote Homer Simpson, there’d be no need for heaven. We’d already be there.";1387

Competing with Jordan Peterson?;https://betonit.substack.com/p/competing-with-jordan-peterson;"A Bet On It reader sent me this email after the Chicago meet-up. Reprinted with his permission. Your reactions? Hey Bryan, Thanks for inviting me to dinner last night. It was a real treat and it was great to meet you in person. I particularly enjoyed hearing about your family's procedure for choosing a college for your sons. When I was deciding where to apply and ultimately where to enroll in early 2008, my thought process was very similar -- where can I get the most bang for my buck to study math and economics? For me it was a full-tuition merit scholarship to Duke that sealed the deal. Likewise, my wife chose Pitt over Penn for her chemical engineering undergraduate studies due to a merit scholarship.  I've been thinking more about your son's idea for you to post some life advice videos for young men. As I said during dinner, I think it's a good idea, definitely worth serious consideration. You've clearly put a lot of thought into your approach to parenting and how to guide your children. That really shone through in your recent interview with Tucker Carlson, like in your discussion about teaching aphorisms to your kids. And I think it fits well with your brand of being thoughtful and candid (even critics label you as ""good-natured"").  Recently NYT opinion columnist Ezra Klein and guest Richard Reeves touched on the life advice topic in a podcast. Here's a quote from it that jumped out at me: That’s the vacuum, I think, Tate and other figures fill, because you can consume the Tate content for most horrible misogynist stuff. But if you watch a lot of it, and I’ve watched a lot of it now, there’s some really good stuff in there. And I’m afraid even to say that out loud, because it’s like, what, Andrew Tate said something good? And the answer is yeah. Like, an example, someone called in to a show he was doing and says, I’m very short, and I know that women prefer tall men. Am I screwed? What should I do, right? And what Tate basically said is, look, mate, you’ve got to deal — you’ve got to deal with the cards you’re dealt. Get yourself in good shape, get yourself sorted out, try and dress — whatever. He just said, that’s just the way it is. He didn’t whinge, he didn’t say — oh, and most importantly, he didn’t start blaming women for preferring taller men. So he just said, that’s the way it is. Let me help you make the best of it. And I just — I watched that clip and thought, “that’s pretty good, actually.” Take the topic from last night about starting at McDonald's and working your way up, showing up on time for three months and getting promoted. To some people that idea will sound trite and obvious, or beneath them. But to my ear it's an engaging topic as well as a candid message that many young men may not have heard much growing up (maybe they're part of today's lucky 10,000). It could be just what they need to hear at the stage they are in their lives. And it's a wise insight into how the world functions. Of course, if you tried this idea out and you wound up getting some traction, there's the potential for serious upside, if Tate's billions of views and Peterson's millions of book sales are any indication. And from an effective altruism lens, it's a lot of good you could potentially do! I'm sure you have plenty of competing ideas for how to focus your scarce time over the coming years, but I think this is worth pondering. [redacted]";651

NIMBY Is Economic Illiteracy;https://betonit.substack.com/p/nimby-is-economic-illiteracy;"Why is housing regulation so draconian? The conventional answer is self-interested voting. Housing regulation is mostly local; local voters are mostly homeowners; homeowners want high housing prices; homeowners know low supply keeps prices high. Economists are especially staunch in their belief in this classic NIMBY (Not In My Backyard) story. Part of the reason is that economists like self-interested stories of everything. In daily life, this is a reasonable presumption. But in politics, most economists have yet to realize that theory and empirics stand squarely against what I call the Self-Interested Voter Hypothesis. Since one voter has near-zero effect on political outcomes, there is near-zero reason to vote on the basis of material self-interest. And a mountain of public opinion research confirms that “symbolic attitudes” - especially ideology and group identity - are the main determinants of issue views, partisanship, and voting itself. Now on Sale! But even economists who accept these truths will still probably try to carve out an exception for housing regulation. What ideology urges us to make housing as expensive as possible?! If naked self-interest doesn’t explain draconian regulation, what on Earth does? My top explanation is sheer economic illiteracy. Much of the public flatly denies that housing deregulation would make housing more affordable. For them, supply-and-demand is the “ideology” - and popular complaints about the downsides of new construction are “common sense.” Do I have any evidence that economic illiteracy is the foundation of draconian housing regulation? Until recently (with notable exceptions), I only had base rates. Since there is overwhelming evidence of the public’s economic illiteracy, of course they’ll be economically illiterate on housing as well. But in 2022, Clayton Nall, Chris Elmendorf, and Stan Oklondzija (henceforth NEO) ran a large survey on the origins of NIMBY. Their recent paper, “Folk Economics and the Persistence of Political Opposition to New Housing” strongly supports my story. What NEO did: We pursued these questions through two surveys with preregistered analysis plans fielded on the Bovitz Forthright panel with a sampling frame defined as adult residents of U.S. urban and suburban zip codes. We instructed the survey vendor to collect equal proportions of homeowners and renters, and to balance the sample on demographics including age, race and gender. The first or pilot survey (n≈2,500) was fielded in March of 2022 and the main survey (n≈3,000) in August of the same year. The findings of the pilot are reported in the Supplemental Information except where the main survey replicates or extends a question from the pilot, in which case we plot results from the pilot alongside the corresponding result from the main survey. Both surveys open with basic demographic questions and, amidst the demographics, a question that asks respondents to think about their city’s future and whether they would prefer home prices and rents to be higher, lower, or the same as today, assuming no change in the economy or quality of life. The surveys then present supply-shock scenarios, elicit perceived effects of the shock on home prices and rents, ask about support for “upzoning” (reducing restrictions on the development of housing), and query respondents about the effects of supply shocks in non-housing markets. What NEO found: In the pilot survey, only about one-third of respondents stated that a 10% positive supply shock would reduce rents and home prices, and a larger number (about 40-45%) answered that a 10% supply shock would increase prices of existing housing. The results in the second column of 4.1 show modestly lower levels of Supply Skepticism in the main survey. Graphically: Look closely. In both studies, the public’s average predicted effect of increased supply on housing prices is roughly ZERO. The median prediction is ALWAYS zero. Homeowner self-interest barely seem to matter at all: The pilot and main surveys yield very similar results, with minimal differences as a function of housing tenure or preferences for higher or lower prices and rents. That owners’ rent predictions are very similar to those of tenants is particularly significant, as it implies that Supply Skepticism is not just a way that owners rationalize self-interested opposition to new housing, i.e., by asserting that it won’t help less-fortunate renters. When NEO test for economic illiteracy in other markets, they detect it. But the economic illiteracy is especially egregious for housing: NEO emphasize the prevalence of textbook reasoning for fertilizer and used car markets, but it’s worth pointing out that the public is pretty awful on free trade and occupational licensing too. If roughly half of the population doubts that restricting supply raises prices, what’s the downside of restricting supply for the flimsiest of reasons? Though NEO explore a lot of other angles, the central message is that economic illiteracy - or as they term it, “Supply Skepticism” - is the factor that explains the wreckage of our status quo: Our results suggest a new explanation for a behavioral puzzle observed in the local political economy literature, namely, that renters are not always supportive of new housing. Hankinson (2018) argues that renters oppose new projects in their neighborhoods out of anxiety that the local amenity effects of new developments will cause their rents to rise. Yet we show that most renters disbelieve that even a large, region-wide increase in the number of new homes would put downward pressure on rents. In a similar deviation from ideal-type behavior, homeowners do not universally believe that a large regional supply increase would reduce home values—and they are not monolithically opposed to additional housing development. Although renters in our samples were somewhat more supportive of land-use liberalization than homeowners, the differences are only 5-10 percentage points, and they pale in comparison to the gap in support, among renters and homeowners alike, for transit-oriented development as compared to “gentle” density in neighborhoods of single-family homes. Is this good news or bad news? As I’ve argued before, given the existence of awful policies, it’s good news. If the status quo were a durable expression of self-interest, it would be nigh invulnerable. Why? Because (a) human nature won’t change, and (b) the costs of bargaining are plainly too high to reconcile our conflicting self-interests. Otherwise, such bargaining would be common already, and we wouldn’t find ourselves in our current predicament. If the problem is economic illiteracy, however, at least we don’t have to change human nature to dramatically change policy. Perhaps we can just repeatedly hit the public over the head with a friendly sledgehammer of economic education. A friendly sledgehammer like… a non-fiction graphic novel on housing regulation.";1124
10% Less Stagnation;https://betonit.substack.com/p/how-ai-will-change-higher-education;"Even though I wrote The Case Against Education, The Chronicle of Higher Education has always treated me well. Their latest issue includes my answer to the following question: When ChatGPT made its public debut last year, the CEO of OpenAI, ChatGPT’s parent company, predicted that its significance “will eclipse the agricultural revolution, the industrial revolution, the Internet revolution all put together.” Even discounting for hyperbole, the release of ChatGPT, followed soon after by Google’s Bard, suggests that we’re at the dawn of an era marked by rapid advances in artificial intelligence, with far-reaching consequences for nearly every facet of higher education. Observing these dizzying developments, we keep circling the same fundamental question: How will AI change higher education? So we’re organizing a forum to gather a wide spectrum of answers to that question. In your response, feel free to take a comprehensive, sector-wide view or to focus on a specific area. Among the questions you might take up: How will AI change the way professors teach and students learn? How will it change the way scholarship happens and knowledge advances? Will AI alter how we think about expertise? Will it shift the role of the university in society? Also feel free to come up with an angle of your own. Finally, you’re welcome to take issue with the premise that AI will significantly change higher ed, and/or that it should.  I’ve spent much of my career arguing that the main function of education is not to teach useful skills (or even useless skills), but to certify students’ employability. By and large, the reason our customers are on campus is to credibly show, or “signal,” their intelligence, work ethic, and sheer conformity. While we like to picture education as job training, it is largely a passport to the real training that happens on the job. How will AI change this? To start, we should bet against any major disruption. Sheer conformity is one of the top traits students want to signal, and doing anything radically new signals… non-conformity. Few students will stop attending traditional colleges to “go” to virtual AI training centers. And since most majors are already barely job-related, few students will rethink their majors either. What will change for students is workload and evaluation. Professors are used to assigning homework, papers, and projects. Using AI to cheat on such work will soon be child’s play. Sufficiently harsh punishments for cheating might preserve the status quo, but modern schools give cheaters a slap on the wrist, and that won’t change. Unmonitored schoolwork will become optional, or a farce. The only thing that will really matter will be exams. And unless the exams are in-person, they’ll be a farce, too. I’m known for giving tough tests of deep understanding - yet GPT-4 already gets A’s on them. The bigger question is how AI will change the labor market itself. As a general rule, new technologies take decades to realize their full potential. The first true trans-Atlantic phone call wasn’t placed until 1956, almost eighty years after the invention of the phone. E-commerce was technically feasible in the mid-90s, but local malls still endure. But we should still expect AI to slowly disrupt a wide range of industries, including CS itself. This will, in turn, slowly alter students’ career aspirations. As an economist, I scoff at the idea that AI will permanently disemploy the population. Human wants are unlimited, and human skills are flexible. Agriculture was humanity’s dominant industry for millennia; yet when technology virtually wiped out agricultural jobs, we still found plenty of new work to do instead. I do not, however, scoff at the idea that AI could drastically reduce employment in CS over the next two decades. Humans will specialize in whatever AI does worst. What about we humble professors? Those of us with tenure have nothing to worry about. Taxpayers and donors will keep funding us no matter how useless we become. Even if you don’t have tenure, students will keep coming and your job will go on… unless you’re at a mediocre private college with a small endowment. Except for cutting-edge empiricists, however, AI will make research even more of a scam than it already is. If Sokal or Boghossian-Lindsey-Pluckrose can successfully “punk” humanities journals, AI will be able to do the same on an industrial scale. If you want a picture of the future, imagine a bot writing a thousand turgid pages a second about “neoliberalism,” “patriarchy,” and “anti-racism” — forever. Outside of the most empirical subjects, the only rationing tools left to determine academic status will be uniquely human: networking and sheer charisma. My fellow scholars, now is a great time to reread Dale Carnegie’s How to Win Friends and Influence People.";815
Pigou's Dial;https://betonit.substack.com/p/pigous-dial;A good intro econ class rubs psychologically normal humans the wrong way… for the first ten weeks. Instead of teaching a familiar pile of Social Desirability Bias, intro econ classes tell students about scarcity, supply-and-demand, and the efficiency of perfect competition. Around week 11, however, intro econ classes switch gears - and start teaching the theory of market failure. Above all, they present the concepts of positive and negative externalities, along with public goods and public bads. Which gives politically-aware students a great excuse to continue believing everything they thought before the class started. “Privatize and let the market work? Bah, haven’t you heard of positive externalities?! Pigou clearly showed that markets undersupply goods with positive externalities, which is why we need widespread government ownership.” “Deregulate and let the market work? Bah, haven’t you heard of negative externalities?! Pigou clearly showed that markets oversupply goods with negative externalities, which is why we need ubiquitous government regulation.” Which brings me to my big message for fellow econ professors: If you allow your students to leave your class with these grotesque confusions, you have utterly failed. The true lesson of Pigou is not that existing economic policy makes sense. The true lesson of Pigou is that existing economic policy is a disgrace. Why? Because the textbook remedy for a positive externality is not government ownership. The textbook remedy is to offer a subsidy equal in size to the externality - then leave the market alone. The textbook remedy for a negative externality, similarly, is not government regulation. The textbook remedy is to impose a tax equal in size to the externality - then leave the market alone. Now notice: Real-world governments almost never handle externalities in this manner. Not even close! Government ownership is ubiquitous, but government subsidies are only a tiny share of GDP. Government regulation - plus full-blown prohibition - is ubiquitous, but taxes on goods with negative externalities are only a tiny share of government revenue. And we almost never see governments offer a subsidy or impose a tax, then say “Our job is done.” Sure, we’ve got a gas tax, but governments combine it with carpool restrictions, CAFE standards, annual inspections, ethanol mandates, and much more. What’s going on? In practice, the concepts of positive and negative externalities are only a smokescreen for the grossly inefficient policies governments habitually favor. Imagine your stereo has a volume control. Call it Pigou’s Dial. The volume runs from 0 to 10. The standard government reaction is roughly: “Your neighbors like your music? Great. It has positive externalities, so raise the volume to 10.” Or: “Your neighbors dislike your music? Oh no. It has negative externalities, so cut the volume to zero.” An enlightened Pigovian, however, speaks no such nonsense. Instead, he says: “How much do your neighbors like your music? A little? OK, I’ll subsidize you to turn the dial from 5 to 6.” Or: “How much do your neighbors dislike your music? Moderately? OK, I’ll tax you to turn the dial from 5 to 3.” Followed by: “So long, have a nice day.” I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again: Yes, the textbook theory of market failure is a reproach to markets. But it is also a massive reproach to all real-world governments, because no earthly government remotely follows a Pigovian approach. Pigou tells us to carefully measure the externality, then set a subsidy or tax of matching size to marginally turn the dial up or down. THE END.;591
Rand and the Enlightenment;https://betonit.substack.com/p/rand-and-the-enlightenment;"I’ve been called arrogant, but I don’t hold a candle to Ayn Rand. She really did say that the only great philosophers were “the three As”: Aristotle, Aquinas, and Ayn Rand. And she heaped contempt on almost everyone else: Plato, Augustine, Descartes, Kant, Hegel, the Pragmatists, the Logical Positivists, and never forget John Rawls. But the three As aside, Rand also had a soft spot for the Enlightenment. While she didn’t say much herself, her followers sound a lot like Steven Pinker in Enlightenment Now. Here’s Leonard Peikoff in The Ominous Parallels, a work fully endorsed Rand herself: The development from Aquinas through Locke and Newton represents more than four hundred years of stumbling, tortuous, prodigious effort to secularize the Western mind, i.e., to liberate man from the medieval shackles. It was the buildup toward a climax: the eighteenth century, the Age of Enlightenment. For the first time in modern history, an authentic respect for reason became the mark of an entire culture; the trend that had been implicit in the centuries-long crusade of a handful of innovators now swept the West explicitly, reaching and inspiring educated men in every field. Reason, for so long the wave of the future, had become the animating force of the present. And: Just as there are no limits to man’s knowledge, many [Enlightenment era] thinkers held, so there are no limits to man’s moral improvement. If man is not yet perfect, they held, he is at least perfectible. Just as there are objective, natural laws in science, so there are objective, natural laws in ethics; and man is capable of discovering such laws and of acting in accordance with them. He is capable not only of developing his intellect, but also of living by its guidance. (This, at least, was the Enlightenment’s ethical program and promise.) Whatever the vacillations or doubts of particular thinkers, the dominant trend represented a new vision and estimate of man: man as a self-sufficient, rational being and, therefore, as basically good, as potentially noble, as a value. Furthermore: The Renaissance represented a rebirth of the Aristotelian spirit. The results of that spirit are written across the next two centuries, which men describe, properly, as the Age of Reason and the Age of Enlightenment. The results include the rise of modern science; the rise of an individualist political philosophy (the work of John Locke and others); the consequent spread of freedom across the civilized world; and the birth of the freest country in history, the United States of America. The great corollary of these results, the product of men who were armed with the knowledge of the scientists and who were free at last to act, was the Industrial Revolution, which turned poverty into abundance and transformed the face of the West. The Aristotelianism released by Aquinas and the Renaissance was sweeping away the dogmas and the shackles of the past. Reason, freedom, and production were replacing faith, force, and poverty. The age-old foundations of statism were being challenged and undercut. In 2021, the Ayn Rand Institute even sponsored a full conference on “Ayn Rand and the Revival of the Enlightenment.” Pretty good stuff, but for my money, the best source on Rand and the Enlightenment is (once again) the late great George Walsh. As part of my ongoing project to make all of Walsh’s recorded lectures publicly available, here’s his quick intellectual history of the Enlightenment - what it was, what it accomplished, and why it matters. Delivered, as always, with Walsh’s vast erudition, keen wit, and dry humor. If memory serves, George Walsh presented the following lecture to the newly-formed Institute for Objectivist Studies circa 1992. Enjoy!";624
Marry the Market: Reflections on Perry's *The Case Against the Sexual Revolution*;https://betonit.substack.com/p/marry-the-market-reflections-on-the;"I read Louise Perry’s The Case Against the Sexual Revolution: A New Guide to Sex in the 21st Century in a single day. If you want a page-turner, look no further. The sentences are gripping, the anecdotes are shocking, and the thesis is eyebrow-furrowing. For pure entertainment, I honestly don’t think I can compete with this book, which strives to convert today’s young feminists to a heretical syncretic creed of sex-negative feminism and social conservatism. Intellectually, however, the book is in need of improvement. My chief thoughts: Many readers will give Perry copious credit for embracing evolutionary psychology in general, and the evolutionary psychology of gender differences in particular. I repeatedly felt this temptation myself. But each time, I asked myself: “When a thinker from a willfully blind intellectual subculture loudly admits the obvious, should we count this as brilliant insight?” If the purpose of praise is simply to give better incentives, then maybe. If a noted creationist publicly converts to Darwinism, perhaps we should throw a parade in his honor. But doesn’t that take “grading on a curve” too far? Perry accuses mainstream feminism of promoting extreme female promiscuity, despite evidence that this is psychologically harmful for most women. At the same time, she is aware that young people today are having less sex than in the past: “[O]ne perverse feature of the twenty-first-century dating market is that the average young person is now having sex less often than their parents and grandparents once did, and there is an increasingly large and frustrated population of men who remain virgins into their twenties and beyond.” But she never considers the possibility that feminism, on balance, reduces promiscuity by amplifying female antipathy for men. In her defense, Perry discusses some sex-positive feminists who plausibly are promoting female promiscuity. The obvious story, though, is that feminism reduces the average amount of sex women have while increasing its variance. When you “raise awareness” of male beastliness, most women feel fear and disgust, leading them to raise their standards for men - or avoid them altogether. At the same time, a minority of women have the opposite reaction: If you can’t beat the beasts, join them. Perry has a whole chapter called “Consent Is Not Enough” which faults other feminists for their sex-positive message of, “All sex between consenting adults is wonderful.” But this is a bizarrely one-sided reading of the contemporary feminist message. Yes, there is a lot of talk of consent. The main purpose of this talk, however, is not to encourage promiscuity, but to raise the bar of what counts as “consent” to absurdly high levels. Most visibly, modern feminists strongly advocate for affirmative consent: “yes means yes” instead of “no means no.” In practice, this means that men are always open to after-the-fact accusations of rape unless they submit to the humiliating and repugnant ritual of repeatedly asking female partners, “Do you now consent to me doing X?” Many feminists also emphasize that “pressure” vitiates consent. Presumably this even includes affirmative consent. What counts as “pressure”? That’s the wrong question. The right question is: “What definitely doesn’t count as pressure?” Does being upset when a woman refuses sex count as “pressure”? How about saying, “I will break up with you unless we have sex”? Once you start down this path, the honest answer is: “Anything could count as pressure. Anything at all.” Closely related: Feminists have also tried to raise awareness of “power imbalances” in relationships, with the strong insinuation that women cannot consent to such relationships - or at least that such consent is forever questionable. And they’ve had remarkable success. On the job, romance between superiors and subordinates is virtually illegal. Even romance between co-workers of equal level is semi-illegal - especially if you realize that - job titles aside - no two co-workers are ever truly “equal.” All in the name of an Orwellian redefinition of “consent.” Upshot: Feminist sermons on “consent” send a mixed message: “All consensual sex is praiseworthy” and “It’s really hard to definitively consent.” The key question is: In practice, what is the mix of these messages? Reading Perry, it sounds like 99:1. But the students I know who have endured mandatory collegiate brainwashing tell me that it’s more than 1:99. While the commissars do call themselves “sex-positive,” this is pro forma. What really obsesses them is the risk that students might somehow mistake non-consent for consent. On the common-sense definition of consent, this is almost impossible. But if you raise the bar enough, it happens all the time. The Case Against the Sexual Revolution is packed with anti-market rhetoric. We know the free market in goods and services is bad; why on Earth would we want a free-market in love and sex? A typical passage: Of course the factory owner supports free marketisation, and of course the wage slave disagrees… This is also true in the sexual marketplace, which was once strictly regulated but has now been made (mostly) free. However, in this case the classes are not the workers and the bourgeoisie but, rather, men and women - or, more precisely, the group of people who have done particularly well out of the free marketisation of sex are men high in the personality trait that psychologists call ‘sociosexuality.’” Such anti-market cliches are a missed opportunity for Perry - and the women she wants to help. Yes, when people have foolish or wicked preferences, free markets satisfy them. Why? Because free markets are a social mechanism for giving people who have something to offer whatever they want. However, free markets are just as eager to satisfy wise and noble preferences. Instead of denouncing the “free marketisation of sex” or telling us that “people are not products,” Perry should be telling her readers to use the free market to their best advantage. True, if you have little to offer, the free market won’t give you much in return. The drug-addicted prostitutes that weigh on Perry’s conscience are unlikely to find stable men eager to marry them. But the vast majority of Perry’s intended audience, however, is in very high demand. The mating market puts immense value on young, well-educated women. Which is great news for readers who take Perry’s pro-marriage advice to heart. True, most young, well-educated women won’t be able to marry handsome, charming investment bankers. But if they set their sights a little lower, they can find a good husband fairly easily. This is especially true if you understand and appreciate how markets work. Suppose a young, well-educated woman finds that none of the men she meets are willing to commit. If she understands and appreciates how markets work, she has two options. The first is to be a little more flexible and forgiving. Don’t just tell yourself, “He doesn’t have to look like a model”; tell yourself, “I’m not a model either, so why should I look down on him?” Don’t lower your standards resentfully; lower your standards with the understanding that you’ve hitherto been unreasonably demanding. The second option is self-improvement. Sure, you can try to improve your appearance. But if you’re looking for a long-term relationship, it’s much more important to improve your attitude. Above all, strive to rid yourself of the deep antipathy toward normal men that permeates Perry’s book. You can accept evolutionary psychology’s truism that men are much hornier than women without looking at normal men as loathsome perverts. Perry says many true things about biologically-rooted gender differences. But she one-sidedly focuses on gender differences that make women look better than men. This isn’t merely unfair and inaccurate; it is counterproductive if you want to help women find fulfilling long-term relationships. What omissions do I have in mind? To start, Perry never even uses the words “hypergamy” or “hypergamous.” So while she accurately describes male lust for many women, she neglects female lust for the very best men. Yet the slogan that “Men are naturally polygamous; women are naturally hypergamous” is basic evolutionary psychology. Misandrists and misogynists use one of these two truisms to denigrate the opposite gender. Misanthropes use both of these two truisms to denigrate both genders. Wise people, however, use one truism to become a better partner - and the other to find a better partner. Avoid temptation - and find a mate who does the same. Men in relationships should avoid spending time alone with attractive women - and women should prefer to be with men who avoid such temptations. Women in relationships should avoid spending time alone with successful men - and men should prefer to be with women who avoid such temptations. Perry’s discussion of personality gender gaps is similarly one-sided. Yes, women are, in terms of the Five Factor Model, more Agreeable. They are kinder and gentler than men. Yet they are also notably higher in Neuroticism. Even if women’s situation is objectively good, they are more prone than men to sadness, anxiety, resentment, and other negative emotions. Perry’s call for men to control their natural feelings is totally sensible, but it’s a two-way street. Men should try to be kinder and gentler. Women should try to be more content and resilient. This isn’t just common decency; such self-improvement ultimately gives you higher value in the mate market and better relations with whatever partner you have. At risk of overstatement, The Case Against the Sexual Revolution offers female readers zero happy options. Hook-up culture is terrible, but Perry’s own choice of marriage and motherhood also sounds bleak: I’ve written earlier in this book about the conflicts between liberal feminists and radical feminists on issues such as prostitution and porn… On motherhood, however, the differences have always been paper thin. Both groups have no answer to the question of how women are supposed to reconcile their search for freedom with a condition that necessarily curtails it. If you value freedom above all else, then you must reject motherhood, since this is a state of being that limits a woman’s freedom in almost every possible way - not only during pregnancy but also for the rest of her life, since she will always have obligations to her children, and they will always have obligations to her… Some feminists insist that women ought to forego motherhood altogether… This does work up to a point - for the individual, at least, if not for the species. But it isn’t possible to reject dependency altogether because, even if a women chooses never to have children, she will one day grow old and depend on other people as if she were an infant all over again. If this sounds like an objective description of harsh realities, I submit that you have a severely Neurotic personality. You are projecting your negative emotionality onto a big package of good and bad. Easy for a dad like me to say? Well, I’m not just a father of four; I exceed the 99th percentile of paternal involvement. I handled every nightshift for every baby. Solo. That includes a pair of twins. I’ve been homeschooling - again, solo - for almost ten years. During Covid, I homeschooled all four of our kids. And through all of this, I never thought my kids “limited my freedom” in the slightest. For me, being a father is a privilege. As I often tell my kids, they are not an interruption of my work. They are my work. And my pride and joy. What goes for parenting also goes for life. Neurotic people project their negative emotionality onto whatever they see. Perry is horrified by hook-up culture, male sexual psychology, Hugh Hefner, porn, sex work, 50 Shades of Gray, and beyond. But it’s hard to imagine her looking at any human society and unironically declaring, “Wow, this is just fantastic, glorious, and inspiring.” Yes, I know that she can’t help being fundamentally Neurotic any more than I can help being fundamentally Disagreeable. But a little self-awareness goes a long way. I know I’m Disagreeable, so I strive to be nicer to people. Once you know you’re Neurotic, similarly, you should strive to see the good in life. Louise Perry combines feminist values with scientific facts to argue for a traditional lifestyle. An intriguing synthesis, I grant. Still, if I knew a man who was dating a Perry fan, I would strongly advise him to find someone else to marry. You don’t want to spend your life with someone who considers you the least-bad of their poor options. You don’t want to spend your life with someone who expresses strong disgust for the typical psychology of your whole gender. You don’t want to spend your life with someone who refuses to sympathetically see life from your point of life once in a while. While I don’t think that Perry explicitly promotes any of these traits, the subtext is overwhelming. What would I advise men to look for? To start, a woman who can smile and shrug at normal gender differences. To continue, a woman capable of sincerely admiring a man who has normal male feelings. At minimum, a woman who doesn’t hold you collectively guilty for the sins of the worst men. Why should women care what men want, anyway? Because the mating market, like other markets, rewards self-improvement of every kind. Adam Smith famously quipped, “It is not from the benevolence of the butcher, the brewer, or the baker, that we expect our dinner, but from their regard to their own interest.” If you bake better bread in the consumer’s eyes, you get more money. If you become a better woman in men’s eyes, you get a better man. I am only a messenger. But isn’t there more to love than a quid pro quo? Sure, because there is more to every market than a quid pro quo! As Dale Carnegie eloquently teaches in his How to Win Friends and Influence People, the best way to succeed socially is to attain a sincere appreciation of the good in other people. So if you want to find a good partner, don’t merely pretend to care about the feelings of the opposite sex. Learn to really do so. This is standard advice for men. It should be standard advice for women, too. To repeat, The Case Against the Sexual Revolution is excellent in many ways. Seriously, it may be my favorite feminist book of all time. Once Perry convinces you that many standard feminist orthodoxies are absurd dogmas, though, you really should dig deeper. How often does any intellectual movement bimodally combine a bunch of absurd dogmas with piles of deep wisdom? Isn’t it more likely that feminism combines its many absurd dogmas with subtle mistakes, half-truths, truisms, and yes, a little deep wisdom? If that’s all your movement has to offer, I say you should salvage what little you can and leave. What is the meta-lesson of Perry’s book? I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again: Don’t be a feminist.";2570
One-Paragraph Book Reviews: Warren Farrell Edition;https://betonit.substack.com/p/one-paragraph-book-reviews-eb6;"I’ve known for years that Warren Farrell’s Why Men Earn More: The Startling Truth Behind the Pay Gap - and What Women Can Do About It existed. But I didn’t actually read it until I was getting ready to write “Don’t Be a Feminist: A Letter to My Daughter.” I liked the book so much that I started wondering, “Who is this ‘Warren Farrell’ - and what else has he done?” The quick answer is that Farrell was one of world’s first male feminists. He wrote The Liberated Man in 1975, and served on the New York City Board of the National Organization for Women. After a few years of berating men for their insensitivity to women, however, he started to wonder if he, fellow feminists, and women in general were - perhaps, maybe, possibly, occasionally - being insensitive to men. Before long, he realized that insensitivity is a broad two-way street - and started writing books to help both men and women give and get better treatment. Though Farrell continues to identify as a feminist, leading mainstream feminists purged him soon after he started asking his heretical questions. As a result, he is now primarily known as a founder of the Men’s Movement. By this point, I’ve read almost all of Farrell’s books. Today, continuing my series of One-Paragraph Book Reviews, I’m going to review his three best. Why Men Earn More: The Startling Truth Behind the Pay Gap - and What Women Can Do About It. At first glance, this book is a popularization of the Beckerian take on the gender pay gap, arguing that the pay gap exists not because of unfairness or “discrimination” but because men and women have different abilities and especially preferences. But much more is going on. Above all, Farrell’s primary goal is not to change discrimination law, but to help women make more money. He enumerates 25 reasons why women make less money in order to alert women to 25 opportunities to make more money. Are you willing to switch to STEM? Work longer hours? Work alone? Commute more? By discussing 25 distinct factors, Farrell’s saying: “Pick a few sacrifices that would bother you the least.” Women can get a lot more money by being a little more flexible about their quality of life. And by implication, men can get much higher quality of life by being a little less focused on money. Most economists will scoff at Farrell’s empirics because he doesn’t do anything like multiple regression. That’s true, but Farrell points out so many blatant differences between typically male and female jobs that academic labor economists barely discuss that he should be scoffing at us. The constructive response, of course, would be for economists to start seriously measuring Farrell’s 25 factors so we can finally do the right multiple regressions. Women Can’t Hear What Men Don’t Say: Destroying Myths, Creating Love. I can almost hear most of my friends throwing up in their mouths when they read this title, but they are utterly in error. (Especially you, R.H.!) Women Can’t Hear What Men Don’t Say is a revelatory book. Women have long complained that men “won’t talk about their feelings,” but Farrell analyzes why men are so prone to bottle up their emotions. Quick version: Women talk about their feelings because they tend to get sympathy and assistance; men keep their feelings to themselves because they tend to get indifference and scorn. But as usual, Farell doesn’t write to condemn; he writes to help readers live better. He dispenses piles of practical advice on how to both “Give criticism so that is easily heard” and “Hear criticism so that it is easily given.” He also speaks for all the silently suffering men who know from bitter experience that talking about their feelings makes their troubles worse. Added bonus: Women Can’t Hear What Men Don’t Say provides an eye-opening aside on the actual data on partner violence. Contrary to almost everything you’ve heard, the frequency and, yes, the severity of female-on-male domestic abuse is similar to male-on-female violence. We don’t hear about wives and girlfriends injuring their men for the same reason we rarely hear about male suffering of any kind: If complaining just adds insult to injury, you keep your mouth shut. Incredulous? Seriously, you won’t be after you read this book. Does Feminism Discriminate Against Men? A Debate, co-authored by Farrell and his opponent, philosopher James Sterba. This book rapidly covers a long list of gender issues: discrimination, health, domestic violence, childcare, custody, education, and much more. Sterba’s performance in the debate markedly exceeded my expectations; he’s possibly my favorite feminist. Sterba avoids ad hominem arguments and maintains a dispassionate tone throughout. He also claims that Farrell makes numerous factual errors - and whenever I checked Sterba’s fact-checking, Sterba was correct. For wisdom, however, Farrell towers over Sterba. Farrell constantly makes reasonable points - and reasonable concessions to the other side - while Sterba argues like a lawyer. Isn’t the male-only draft, military slavery that led millions of men (and near-zero women) around the world to die in combat over the last century, an undeniable case of unfairness to men? According to Sterba, absolutely not! Farrell and Benatar maintain that the male-only draft and the combat exclusion of women is primarily a form of sexism that benefits women. But how could this be, when denying women access to combat roles denies women access to the most prestigious positions in the military and hinders their advancement both within and without the military? Sterba occasionally reminds Farrell that the issue under debate is not “Does Society Treat Men More Fairly Than Women?” but “Does Feminism Discriminate Against Men?” And he correctly points out that much of the alleged unfairness that males endure relative to women long predated feminism. Feminists obviously didn’t start the all-male draft. Yet strictly speaking, both Farrell and Sterba are off-topic most of the time. The book is simply mistitled; it should have been called Is Feminism True? A Debate or Does Society Treat Men More Fairly Than Women? A Debate. P.S. The final review counts as one paragraph. The formatting just looked terrible when I tried to insert the blockquote in the text. :-)";1074
Fat Tail Fixation;https://betonit.substack.com/p/fat-tail-fixation;"Nassim Taleb is famous, among other things, for his focus on “fat tails.” If events are normally distributed, the chance a year will be three standard deviations worse than average is about 1-in-a-1,000. Yet annual stock marker returns are often three SD worse than normal. To show global war deaths, similarly, you need a logarithmic scale: The lesson: Either humanity has been getting absurdly unlucky, or important distributions in the real world must have “fat tails.” Taleb, as you probably recall, has a special name for fat-tail disasters: “black swans.” And he’s famously angry that we don’t take black swans much more seriously. A typical Taleb passage: Let us illustrate one of the problem of thin-tailed thinking with a real world example. People quote so-called ""empirical"" data to tell us we are foolish to worry about ebola when only two Americans died of ebola in 2016. We are told that we should worry more about deaths from diabetes or people tangled in their bedsheets. Let us think about it in terms of tails. But, if we were to read in the newspaper that 2 billion people have died suddenly, it is far more likely that they died of ebola than smoking or diabetes or tangled in their bedsheets? The final sentence is eminently reasonable. But on reflection, Taleb’s claim would still stand even if ebola deaths did follow a normal distribution! How? Just imagine that the universe “throws the dice” for bedsheet deaths a billion times a day, but throws the dice for ebola deaths only once per decade - or once per century. Even if every dice throw is normally distributed, you are far more likely to get 2 billion deaths in the latter scenario. In fact, conditional on 2 billion people dying, ebola is trillions of times more likely than bedsheets to be the cause. Scary? That still depends on the unconditional odds of 2 billion people dying. If that is a one-in-a-billion event, complacency remains the path of wisdom. As I explained in my 2018 conversation with Taleb: Suppose we’re talking about the possibility that one day you were going to eat something lethally poisoned. One thing you could do is take a lot of precautions against eating poison. You could hire a poison taster, or you go and read up about what kinds of foods are hard to poison. On the other hand, you could just go and say, “Hardly anyone today gets poisoned by lethal poison put in their food. So low probability, and I’m not worried about it.” The latter reaction is actually my reaction. Am I wrong? Should I have been worried about being lethally poisoned or not? My general point: The case for caution depends on many factors. Sure, “fat tails” are one reason to be nervous. Another is: “the universe throws the dice rarely.” Then there’s: “The cost of caution is low” and “The bad outcomes are truly awful.” And never forget, “Caution won’t greatly amplify the risk of other awful outcomes.” Pace Taleb, we shouldn’t fixate on fat tails. We should weigh all these factors and more, then do standard cost-benefit analysis. At this point, I’m tempted to opine on the possibility that AI will exterminate humanity. I know that many smart people are terrified; I even bet one of the smartest such people. Obviously several of the preceding factors - fat tails included - weigh in favor of fear. But others weigh against. The cost of caution is very high; unless humanity shuts down the internet, AI will keep improving rapidly. And yes, crushing AI really does amplify the risk of other awful outcomes. Like nuclear war, as my doomsday betting partner hair-raisingly admits: Make it explicit in international diplomacy that preventing AI extinction scenarios is considered a priority above preventing a full nuclear exchange, and that allied nuclear countries are willing to run some risk of nuclear exchange if that’s what it takes to reduce the risk of large AI training runs. Despite my temptation to opine, I won’t. I’ve listened to the fearful past the point of patience, and I remain convinced that the risks of AI extermination are barely worth thinking about. And for once, the vast majority of humanity seems to agree with me: Even if you can get most people to say we’re doomed, only a few nerds are panicking. If you’re in the worried minority, I don’t know how to change your mind. All I can do is affirm my continued willingness to bet against AI disaster.";778
Hard to Sue: A Feature Not a Bug;https://betonit.substack.com/p/hard-to-sue-a-feature-not-a-bug;Long before there was zoning, there was the law of nuisance. Though your neighbors couldn’t tell you what to build on your own land, they could sue you if they didn’t like what you built. As Wikipedia explains: Under the common law, persons in possession of real property (land owners, lease holders etc.) are entitled to the quiet enjoyment of their lands. However this doesn't include visitors or those who aren't considered to have an interest in the land. If a neighbour interferes with that quiet enjoyment, either by creating smells, sounds, pollution or any other hazard that extends past the boundaries of the property, the affected party may make a claim in nuisance. Rather vague, you will notice. In principle, almost anything is arguably a “nuisance.” If a neighbor builds a skyscraper that blocks your sunlight, you could try crying “nuisance.” What, then, was the point of piling modern housing regulation on top of the pre-existing body of nuisance law? Law professors can enlighten you on the actual legal history. Most economists, however, will confidently share the following Just-So story: Nuisance law offered inadequate protection against nuisances, because suing others is a pain in the neck. The vast majority of people who are theoretically able to sue decline to do so. As a result, the legal system under-deters negative externalities. In principle, the court system could surmount this problem by increasing awards, forcing defendants to pay court costs, fully accounting for the opportunity cost of plaintiff’s time and aggravation, and so on. But once you recognize the extreme inconvenience and endemic under-deterrence of the legal process, why not just hire a full-time regulatory team to reliably stop problems before they start? What’s true for zoning is true for virtually all regulation. If existing law doesn’t allow people to sue others for X, the standard solution is to create a regulatory bureau. The other, however, is to change the law so people can sue for X. Why not? Economists’ go-to answer, again, is that suing is inconvenient, so lawsuits alone lead to under-deterrence. This is all eminently plausible, until you notice one Big Fact: Humans tend to make enormous numbers of ridiculous complaints. The whiniest humans barely do anything but complain. A single individual filed 6,500 noise complaints against DC’s Reagan Airport! Once you accept this basic psychological fact, the fear of “under-deterrence” of offensive behavior pales. And a new fear rises: Fear that we’ll take humanity’s endless petty complaints seriously. Verily, we should be sweating bullets, because if we take the typical complaint seriously, life will grind to a halt. Picture the current difficulty of building a skyscraper in San Francisco in spite of all the attendant complaints. Now picture a world where everything is like that. The mainstream case for regulation over lawsuits isn’t all wrong. Yes, regulation is indeed a (somewhat) more streamlined system for processing complaints. Suing other people is indeed a (massive) pain in the neck. What mainstream economists miss is that given the rancorous nature of man, the inconvenience of lawsuits for the plaintiff is a great good. Truly a feature, not a bug. If you create a bureau of government employees and tell them, “Listen to people’s complaints and do something about them,” you get the firehose of whining and action that we now take for granted. In contrast, if you tell complainers, “Don’t like it? Find a good lawyer,” almost all of them will shrug and suck it up. As they should.;602
Happy Natalist Mother's Day!;https://betonit.substack.com/p/happy-natalist-mothers-day;"Just in time for Mother’s Day, Bet On It reader Anna Krupitsky has used AI to created an audiobook of my Selfish Reasons to Have More Kids. Since Amazon now has a problem with AI-read audiobooks, she’s sharing Selfish Reasons and the other audiobook versions of my works over on Youtube. She also sent me a lovely message to share. Here’s Anna! In 2013, I jokingly wrote this post on my Facebook wall: Now that my twins are about to turn one, I'm taking a step to reveal the darkest secret that all parents of twins keep from the world. When we had three kids, people told us that was a lot. We disagreed, read Judith Harris, and enjoyed each one of them. It wasn't a lot. Then we read Bryan Caplan's Selfish Reasons. We decided to have another one. Another one turned out to be a set of two. We thought, well, THIS is going to be too much. This is going to be a disaster. Now, I'm going to divulge the information I acquired after a year spent in the company of these two (and the rest), with detailed knowledge on the matter: twins are not a disaster. To make matters worse, they are NOT EVEN HARD. Twins are not only more fun than singletons; they are, in fact, easier to take care of! If anyone wants detailed information on the matter, contact me privately, but please secure your communication. Keep in mind the big conspiracy that twin parents are running against the common citizens of the world. Please don't let them make you think that twins are to be avoided by all means and that they deserve your sympathy by claiming they are having a hard time. Now, I'm ready to face prosecution and denigration from them and take responsibility for all consequences. In 2016 we had another baby, and 2019 - another. The age difference between the oldest and the youngest is 20 years. Yet, the bond between all seven of them is unbelievably strong!  I can't properly count my blessings because I'd get too emotional. The pleasure, meaning, and happiness these kids bring to my life are incredibly immense.  We all have that one book that we wish we could make the whole world read. That book is certainly Selfish Reasons to Have More Kids for me, and should be for all of us. This is the book that can increase individual happiness and make the world a more prosperous place simultaneously, is easy to read, and wouldn't polarize. It challenges our preconceived notions about parenting and the impact each additional human makes on the world.  The other day, I had a brief chat with a woman who is a mother of one child. In the end, she gave me a pity hug because she felt bad for me having seven. I also gave her a pity hug because I genuinely felt sorry for her for stopping at one. I thought, if only she would read Selfish Reasons or could at least listen to it! [Back to Bryan] I’m proud of all my books, but Selfish Reasons to Have More Kids is the only one that I’m confident has actually made a big real-world difference. Hundreds of readers have told me that my words raised their family size by at least one. Using economist’s usual $10 million or so per life, that’s billions of dollars of value I’ve added to the world. So again, Happy Mother’s Day!";601
Bet On It: The Central European Tour;https://betonit.substack.com/p/bet-on-it-the-central-european-tour;I’m doing a European tour this June. The signature event is my talk on “Selfish Reasons to Have More Kids” in Warsaw for kongres590 on either June 21 or 22. The Myth of the Rational Voter, Selfish Reasons to Have More Kids, The Case Against Education, and Open Borders have all been translated into Polish, which I take as a strong sign of the country’s intellectual excellence. (Admittedly, it’s a little confusing why the Poles translate at all, because their English is so good). But I’m actually arriving weeks earlier in Frankfurt-am-Main, and speaking in Vienna, Prague, and elsewhere before my keynote in Warsaw. Whenever I go, I’ll try to set up meet-ups with Bet On It readers. And I’m open to other possibilities, including talks, AMAs, and beyond. My tentative schedule: June 4 - Frankfurt - heavily jet-lagged, but eating at approximately 3 PM at the delicious Istanbul Fisch Grill June 5 - Rothenburg ob der Tauber, Nuremberg, Lenting June 6 - Ingolstadt, Munich. Munich meet-up at Wirtshaus Zum Straubinger at 7 PM. June 7 - Innsbruck, Lofer, Bad Reichenhall June 8 - Berchtesgaden, Salzburg June 9 - Linz. Meet-up at Stiegl-Klosterhof at 5 PM. June 10 - Graz June 11-13 - Vienna - speaking event the evening of June 12 at 7 PM at scholarium. Address: Schlösselgasse 19/2/18, A-1080. Please register at info@scholarium.at. June 14-17 - Prague. Speaking for Czech Students for Liberty on June 15 at 7 PM at Cafe Therapy. June 18-19 - Wrocław. Speaking for Poland’s Instytut Misesa on June 19 at 4 PM at Wydział Prawa Administracji i Ekonomii Uniwersytetu Wrocławskiego, room 418, building A, Uniwersytecka street 22/26. June 20-22 - Warsaw - two events. Speaking for the Instytut Misesa and Warsaw Enterprise Institute on June 21 6 PM at Świetlica Wolności (Nowy Świat 6/12). Speaking at kongres590 on June 22 at 1 PM. June 23 - Poznań, speaking event at 7 PM at Wydział Filozoficzny UAM at Adam Mickiewicz University. June 24 - Berlin June 25 - Hannover, meet-up at 8 PM at Waterloo Biegarten. June 26 - Cologne June 27-28 - Frankfurt. Meet-up at Orange Beach at 9 PM on June 27. If you want to meet-up at any of these locations, or wish to organize an event, please share in the comments. I’ll update this page as more details and events come in. Looking forward to seeing a lot of old friends and making new ones! Rothenburg ob der Tauber;420
Best Lectures on Protestant Fundamentalism, Ever;https://betonit.substack.com/p/best-lectures-on-protestant-fundamentalism;[Lecture #2 is back up. Sorry for the strangeness.] My project to bring the lost George Walsh recordings to the world continues. With the technical assistance of the Salem Center, I offer you Walsh’s two grand lectures on Protestant Fundamentalism. Have you ever wondered, “What exactly do Protestant fundamentalists actually think?” Have you ever wondered, “Why can’t an historian of thought analyze Protestant fundamentalism with the same rigor routinely paid to Aristotelianism, Kantianism, Marxism, or Rawlsianism?” Either way, Walsh has you covered. Noah’s Ark A little extra background: Early in Lecture #1, Walsh explains that modern Protestant fundamentalism, shockingly, began at the Princeton Theological Seminary - and Wikipedia backs him up: The seminary was made famous during the 19th and early 20th centuries for its defense of Calvinistic Presbyterianism, a tradition that became known as Princeton Theology and greatly influenced Evangelicalism during the period. Some of the institution's figures active in this movement included Charles Hodge, B.B. Warfield, J. Gresham Machen, and Geerhardus Vos… In response to the increasing influence of theological liberalism in the 1920s and the Fundamentalist–Modernist Controversy at the institution, several theologians left to form the Westminster Theological Seminary under the leadership of J. Gresham Machen. The college was later the center of the Fundamentalist–Modernist Controversy of the 1920s and 1930s.[16] In 1929, the seminary was reorganized along modernist lines, and in response, Machen, along with three of his colleagues: Oswald T. Allis, Robert Dick Wilson and Cornelius Van Til, resigned, with Machen, Allis and Wilson founding Westminster Theological Seminary in Glenside, Pennsylvania. Princeton Theological Seminary Last summer, when I was lecturing for the John Locke Institute at the Princeton Theological Seminary, I thought of Walsh’s lectures on Protestant fundamentalism every day. How very strange it was to walk the halls where the founders of these academically understudied yet practically potent ideas once walked. Whatever your views on Protestant fundamentalism - and fundamentalism in general - I think you’ll be delighted by these lectures. There are some thinkers that you proverbially “can’t stay mad at.” Walsh is in the superior category of thinkers that you “can’t get mad at in the first place.” So learned, so funny, so wise. I only met him once at the age of 18 - and I still count myself lucky. And now, the main event. Here’s Lecture #1: Theology and Epistemology. And here’s Lecture #2: Ethics and Politics.;407
Hundreds of Posts I Haven't Written Yet;https://betonit.substack.com/p/hundreds-of-posts-i-havent-written;In high school, I was clearly dumber than my four best friends. In my Princeton Ph.D. program, I considered my intelligence average at best. Yet I basically never met anyone who seemed more creative than me. I have far more ideas than even the most workaholic version of myself could ever actually write up. New ideas come so quickly that I’m in grave danger of forgetting most of them. Which is why I rush to write my ideas down lest they be lost forever. Isn’t that distracting? Sure, but I usually just jot down a title. If you want get the most out of your creativity, I highly recommend the practice. Create a queue of original ideas worth exploring. If, in hindsight, your idea sucks, let it languish. No one will ever find out. I know, I know: “I’m so creative” sounds like pathetic braggadocio. Perhaps I delude myself, so judge for yourself. Below is a list of titles of blog posts I never got around to writing between 2005 and 2022. For about 20%, I’m hazy on what the post was even supposed to be about. Doh! I should have added a subtitle. P.S. If there are any titles you’d especially like me to complete, please inform me in the comments.

Instead of Illusion;https://betonit.substack.com/p/instead-of-illusion;When I ponder the Big Questions, I strive to preserve the separation of reason and emotion. Or, if you prefer, the separation of thinking and wishful thinking. The world is full of pretty lies and ugly truths - and we have a duty to spurn the lies and embrace the truths. Even if the truth hurts, or makes us unpopular. I know that people find solace in their ideological dogmas. I want to take their dogmas away from them nonetheless. Sure, you can dismiss this as self-serving megalomania: “I, the noble truth-seeker, stand above the childish feelings of mere mortals.” But some critics have taken me at my word - and found fault in me. More than once, I’ve been accused of being a Vulcan. Or as McCloskey recently remarked, “I am against Bryan Caplan, if you see what I mean. Not personally against him, but against his relentless appeal to the head instead of the heart.” The truth, though, is that I seek solace like anyone else. Probably far more than most people, actually. While I embrace the separation of thinking and wishful thinking (along with its understudied twin, morbid thinking), I spend hours every day lost in worlds of fantasy. And I never want to give my fantasy worlds up. What on Earth am I talking about? Most obviously, I listen to music almost non-stop. Classical and especially opera, and German opera über alles, is my homeland, but I adore almost every genre of music. Heavy metal is my latest obsession. I know full well that music lyrics often paint a ridiculously biased - even risible - view of the human condition and the social world. But in the words of Jack Skellington in The Nightmare Before Christmas: In these little bric-a-brac A secret's waiting to be cracked These dolls and toys confuse me so Confound it all, I love it though Sure, music lyrics tell us more about human nature than HR propaganda. Love songs willfully omit a lot of Big Facts about human relationships, but they also announce truths that most humans are too embarrassed to admit. Though there are few songs about unplanned pregnancy, there are many about unrequited love. But the main reason I listen to music all the time is not to learn anything. I listen to music all the time to savor its multiverse of fantasy. What is “Master of Puppets” even about? I don’t know, but I keep listening to it. Music aside, I’ve crafted hundreds of stories, almost all for role-playing games. I spent most of my childhood “world-building” - creating a fictional universe for my friends’ Dungeons & Dragons adventures. Over the last twenty years, I’ve branched out to dozens of other genres. Horror. Crime. Historical fiction. Historical crime fiction. Absurdism. Post-apoc. Dystopian. Narco-telenovelas. Biblical epics. Even Japanese baseball sagas. After a good game ends, my fictional world feels more real to me than the real world for hours and hours. So what? Most intellectually active people that I observe cope with the ugliness of the world by embracing a dogmatic political religion. While I could single-mindedly rail against wokeness or the bizarro world of the mainstream media, I’m clear-sighted enough to admit that the same goes for people I broadly agree with. Most libertarians, for example, turn their libertarianism into a dogmatic political religion. Which is itself an ugly truth. My point: There is another path. A better path. Instead of coping with the ugliness of the world with wishful thinking, deliberately take the time to think about something other than the real world. Lose yourself in the wonder of music. Lovingly populate a fictional universe with characters larger-than-life. Read novels. Watch movies. Daydream. Once you admit that imagination is not a path to truth, let your imagination run wild. Instead of fusing thinking and wishful thinking, bifurcate the two. Cherish your rich inner fantasy life. Don’t let anyone take it away from you. Just don’t confuse this fantasy life with the way things really are.;683
The Cost is Zero - or Astronomical;https://betonit.substack.com/p/the-cost-is-zero-or-astronomical;Education seems enormously expensive - $13,494 per K-12 student as of 2020 in the U.S. Yet I’ve occasionally heard smart people argue that the true cost of the marginal student is roughly zero. How is that possible? Take a look at a classroom. It almost always has a spare seat. The building’s already there. The teacher’s already there. What does it cost to just let one more student sit in that seat and learn? Basically nothing, right? Since I keep inviting the whole world to come to GMU and informally attend my classes, I cannot summarily reject the claim that the true cost of the marginal student is roughly zero. The reason I can casually offer free Caplan lectures to all comers is that neither I nor anyone else has to pay extra to fulfill my offer. Educational resources sit idle. Rather than let them go to waste, why not use them? But you need not summarily reject this argument to recognize its limits. The marginal cost of welcoming additional students is zero… until the room is full. “We can costlessly switch to another room,” you say? Well, what happens if that room reaches capacity? Eventually, you run out of bigger rooms - or at least bigger rooms that are available for zero added expense. And when that happens, the marginal cost of adding another student suddenly becomes astronomical! Suppose you can teach a class of 30 students for $500,000. If you only have 27 students, the marginal cost of student #28 is zero. So is the marginal cost of students #29 and #30. To add student #31, however, you need to start a whole second classroom. Marginal cost? $500,000! Instead of being below the average per-pupil cost of $16,667, it’s 30 times as high. There is a general principle at work. The naive view of the world is that the cost of every individual equals the average cost. The sophisticated view is that the cost of the typical individual equals zero. The even more sophisticated view, though, is that the cost of the typical individual is either roughly zero - or almost astronomical. Expectationally, the naive view is not far wrong: If the current population of a class is uniformly distributed from 0-30, the expected cost of adding a student is 29/30*$0 + 1/30*Total Cost, which exactly equals Average Cost. Sometimes, granted, we know the current population of a class. I know that I have plenty of room for guests in my classrooms, therefore I know that the marginal cost is zero. When you’re planning a whole school system, in contrast, you have to guess how many students you’re going to have, so you should use the expected cost. Which is our old friend Average Cost. Once you take this insight seriously, don’t all arguments (including pro-immigration arguments) based on non-rivalry vanish in a puff of smoke? No, because sometimes the marginal cost of a good remains zero over an enormous range. Ideas, most notably, are the quintessential non-rival good - and the marginal cost of letting one more person use an idea remains roughly zero all the way to infinity. Non-rivalry is real. It’s just not a real as it looks. A problem I’ve never had.;558
Hard Rock Party May 19;https://betonit.substack.com/p/hard-rock-party-may-19;This May 19, all Bet On It readers are invited to hear Georgetown philosopher Jason Brennan’s band perform live at my house in Oakton, Virginia for a belated birthday party. Jason is most famous for Against Democracy, Markets Without Limits, and Cracks in the Ivory Tower. He and I were jointly attacked for our “libertarian elitism” in the latest issue of Democracy: A Journal of Ideas. But when Brennan isn’t rocking academia, he’s making music - as both guitarist and lead singer. I saw his band, Fürst Try, open for The Four Horsemen - and if you’ll permit a Wayne’s World reference, Jason’s band wails. I’ve hand-picked the set list to overdose on Led Zeppelin, Metallica, Black Sabbath, Ozzy Osbourne, AC/DC, and (fingers crossed) Bad Religion. Before and after the concert, this event doubles as a DC-area Bet On It meet-up. But the band plays loud, so you may have trouble chatting during the concert… which is thirty songs long. And even if no one else dances, be warned: I shall dance. The event starts at 6 PM, and the band goes on at 7:30. Dinner served. As always at my events, kids are super-welcome. Tiny hurdle: If you want to attend, email me for details. Just google my name to find it. Hope you can make it! Master of Puppets;232
Voters as Mad Scientists: The Hanania Interview;https://betonit.substack.com/p/voters-as-mad-scientists-the-hanania;In the latest podcast of the Center for the Study of Partisanship and Ideology, Richard Hanania interviews me about my new book, Voters as Mad Scientists: Essays on Political Irrationality. From Hanania’s write-up: Much of the conversation then centers around Caplan’s simplistic theory of the right and left. This is compared and contrasted with Scott Alexander’s thrive/survive theory of the political spectrum, Robin Hanson’s theory of farmers and foragers, and Hanania’s “Liberals Read, Conservatives Watch TV.” Near the end, the discussion turns to the political climate at GMU, and whether the intellectual community that has been built can survive the trend towards DEI. Very fun, but even more fun if you read the book! Hint hint.;123
Unanimity Forever;https://betonit.substack.com/p/unanimity-forever;"When I attack housing regulation, market-oriented economists occasionally push back. “Do you have a problem with homeowners’ associations (HOAs)?” they ask. No, I don’t. “Even when they tell you what you can and can’t do with your own house and land?” That, I affirm, is the whole point of an HOA. “Well,” the critics continue, “what’s the difference between HOAs and local government? If the former can rightfully restrict what you do with your own home and your own land, why not the latter?” My answer is simple: The difference is that HOAs start with unanimous consent. You can’t launch a new HOA unless you get all of the members to voluntarily join. Which is like pulling teeth! Upshot: In the real world, HOAs are almost always founded not by homeowners coming together, but by the initial developer. How? Developers create HOAs by imposing three conditions of the sale on each and every original owner: The buyer agrees to submit to the authority of the HOA. The buyer agrees to require the next owner to agree to (1) if they ever sell their home. The buyer agrees to require the next owner to agree to (2) if they ever sell their home. As a result of these carefully-crafted contractual conditions, 100% of the members of the HOA - past, present, and future - consent to belong. In stark contrast, local governments essentially never start with unanimous consent. Usually you’re lucky if they even start with majority support. Democracies often pretend that their constitutions were in some sense unanimously adopted, but that is a blatant lie. If “You consented by not leaving the country” is consent, then consent is empty verbiage. Social contract theory, despite its popularity, is false to the point of absurdity. False to the point of absurdity for federal governments. False to the point of absurdity for state governments. And yes, false to the point of absurdity for local governments. See Huemer’s The Problem of Political Authority, chapters 2 and 3, if you have the slightest doubt. A book of answers Why make such a big deal about unanimous consent? Because anything less than unanimity means that some participants participate at the point of a gun. Picture a massive construction project. 10,000 workers toil side-by-side. What would you think if you learned that a single plumber was there under the CEO’s threat of violence? Instead of being a noble undertaking, the project is a criminal enterprise. A very big deal. As an economist, I’m tempted to reply, “Unanimous consent is a noble aspiration, but in the real world, doesn’t this noble aspiration have an astronomical cost?” Yet I also have a lengthy reply to this tempting reply. Namely: Unanimous consent has ghastly effects in nightmare scenarios, like “What if the only way to save the world is to make 100% of humans give you $1 each?” In the real world, however, unanimous consent is, on balance, glorious. Unanimous consent is the bodyguard of autonomy and the life-giving air of progress. How so? Due to the immense diversity of human preferences and beliefs, unanimous consent is impossible for any sizable society to attain. You can still undertake large projects by using selection and incentives to assemble a subset of a sizable society: “If you don’t like how our group works, don’t join.” But for all practical purposes, unanimous consent ensures that no creed and no crusade can triumph even for a day, much less the rest of history. How is that good? Because almost all creeds and almost all crusades are wrong! This is undeniable because there are so many incompatible creeds and so many incompatible crusades. And even if your creed or your crusade is right, right does not make might. The odds that the one thing that’s right prevails against everything that’s wrong is slim indeed. Unanimity ensures that no one and nothing fully wins. Which, given these harsh realities, is for the best. Facile, you say? Think about what “fully wins” actually means. Once a creed or crusade fully wins, it rigs the system to ensure that it keeps winning - year after year, century after century. It reforges institutions to crush opposition before its birth. Before its conception! Which means an end to progress as well as autonomy. Even if a ruling creed was the best approximation to the truth in its day, what are the odds that it will be the best forever? Even if a ruling crusade was the best course of action in its day, what, again, are the odds that it remains the best course of action for all time? Too abstract? Try this thought experiment. Literally everyone joins a massive HOA. The HOA then makes enthusiastic support of the Current Thing mandatory for all members for all time. The contract therefore doesn’t just bind current owners; it binds all their descendants unto ages of ages. Sure, you can leave your parents’ house when you grow up, but every other house on Earth signed the same contract. You are stuck! We support the Current Thing… for all eternity. Terrifying, yes? Then take comfort in the fact that it will never ever happen in the real world. You can’t get 100% of people to concede that the sky is blue. Getting 100% of people to join your HOA? Forget about it. In the real world, the requirement of unanimous consent preserves autonomy for you, your children, and your children’s children. Which in turn preserves the possibility of progress. Philosophers often contrast the “negative freedom” to be left alone against the “positive freedom” to flourish. “Positive freedom”: it’s a strange abuse of language. If you were the only person on Earth, you’d be poor and lonely, but clearly free. What the preceding thought experiment shows is that by-the-book “negative” freedom stubbornly shields the autonomy and progress that the slogan of “positive freedom” awkwardly tries to capture. The good news: In the real world, it is unanimity, not uniformity, that is self-perpetuating. As long as there are a reasonable number of realistically contentious humans, they’ll never all contractually converge on anything. Which means that autonomy - and progress - shall continue. Not just for the humans who live today, but as long as the fractious human spirit endures. Unity.";1068
Best Lecture on Puritanism, Ever;https://betonit.substack.com/p/best-lecture-on-puritanism-ever;George Smith (1949-2022) was a learned and extraordinarily charismatic autodidact. A wunderkind, or close to it, Smith published his most famous book, Atheism: The Case Against God, when he was only 25.  I met him at a Cato Institute Summer Seminar in 1990, and again in the summer of 1991. Talking to George was always thrilling. He once bragged that he dropped out of high school to start college, dropped out of college to start a Ph.D., and then dropped out his Ph.D. program to join the faculty of the Institute for Humane Studies’ Liberty and Society seminars.  The following lecture, delivered around 1991, promotes Atheism, Ayn Rand, and Other Heresies, a book of his masterful essays on philosophy and the history of ideas. The intro is a risque PG-13, but please don’t freak out. The body of the talk is a deep – and deeply-entertaining - intellectual history of the ethics and psychology of puritanism. Enjoy.;161
Gun Rights: A Guide for Kids;https://betonit.substack.com/p/gun-rights-a-guide-for-kids;I’m a parent of four, and I oppose gun control. Whenever there’s a tragic school shooting in the news, activists loudly call for more restrictions on guns. Many plainly want to just ban guns. Even when they explicitly deny this goal, activists’ arguments normally imply the desirability of a ban. If you’re a kid, it’s only natural to ask, “Why not ban guns?” Here’s what I tell my kids when they ask. When tragedy strikes, most human beings have a passionate emotional reaction: “We have to do something about this!” Though this is only natural - indeed, because this is only natural - we have a strong moral duty to delay action until we are ready to think carefully and calmly. Otherwise, we risk doing great evil. You shouldn’t even drive when you’re upset, much less pass legislation. In 2001, for example, the U.S. experienced a tragic terrorist attack - and responded by invading two countries, Afghanistan and Iraq. Hundreds of thousands of innocent people died as a result, and twenty-two years later, it is unclear what the payoff is even supposed to be. Why did Americans do this? Because they acted on their grief and rage, instead of thinking carefully and calmly. If we think carefully and calmly, what do we learn about guns and violence? In 2021, guns were used to commit about 21,000 out of 26,000 U.S. homicides. One year earlier, 32% of American adults surveyed owned guns. That’s over 80 million people - or about one gun murder per 4000 gun owners. The implication is clear: The overwhelming majority of gun owners are totally harmless. When a black man murders someone, we don’t punish all blacks. Instead, we try to punish the guilty - and leave the innocent in peace. Why shouldn’t we show gun owners the same consideration? Why should we scapegoat millions for the crimes of a few monsters? You could reply, “Sure, banning guns is unfair to the vast majority of gun owners. But the gains of banning guns are so massive that we should do it anyway.” This is a tempting conclusion when you first hear the murder statistics. If we could stop 21,000 murders a year by mistreating eighty million innocent gun owners, maybe that would be justified. Maybe. In the real world, however, passing a law saying, “Guns are banned” does not make all guns vanish. Plenty of gun owners will keep their guns despite the law. Furthermore, some would-be gun murderers will give up their guns and kill with other weapons instead. Researchers have tried to estimate the fraction of murders a gun ban would actually prevent, but the best place to start is common sense. Do you honestly think that even a 50% reduction is likely? Even anti-gun activists know that lots of people will break the laws they pass. After all, they already managed to get strict gun control in the nation’s murder capitals… and those cities are still the nation’s murder capitals. How is this possible? Because people who break laws against murder are also prone to break laws against gun ownership. Activists’ hope is that if they expand strict gun control to the entire country, guns will stop flowing from low-regulation areas to high-regulation areas - and the laws they love will finally start working well. Maybe they’re right, but you’d think they’d be severely disappointed by the flimsy payoff of the laws they’ve already managed to pass. On reflection, gun bans conceivably increase gun homicides. “If guns are outlawed, only outlaws will have guns” is a long-standing pro-gun slogan - and as slogans go, few are more insightful. Self-defense is a major motive for gun ownership. Many Americans live in high crime areas, and guns help them protect themselves. Though few guns are ever used to stop a crime, every gun is an insurance policy: If a bad guy shows up, you can scare him, and you can shoot him. Furthermore, the knowledge that lots of American households own guns is plainly a serious deterrent to all sorts of crime. Since criminals rarely know if a potential victim owns a gun, the guns your neighbors own indirectly protect you, too. This is not mere ideology: If you were tempted to break into someone’s house, wouldn’t you wonder, “Gee, what if they own a gun?” The other major motive for gun ownership is recreational: Outside of big cities, target-shooting and hunting are big hobbies. Sure, you can cavalierly tell them, “Get another hobby,” but why should they have to? We don’t talk about banning swimming pools every time a child tragically drowns in a swimming pool. We don’t talk about banning recreational driving every time a family tragically perishes on a road trip. Yes, you can say, “If the number of deaths averted is massive enough, then a ban is justified despite the unfairness to innocent hobbyists.” But activists almost never even tell us the cutoff, much less share strong evidence that we’re over the cutoff. Some countries, such as Japan, have almost no guns and almost no murders. It’s tempting to think that the U.S. could mimic them, but that’s absurdly optimistic. Look at this table of per-capita gun ownership by country, and compare it to this table of murder rates by country. On the guns table, the U.S. is #1. On the murder table, the U.S. is #61. Canada is #7 in guns, and #114 in murders. Jamaica is #92 in guns, and #2 in murders. This doesn’t prove that gun control has zero effect, but it does show that guns are, at most, one risk factor among a great many. Some defenders of gun rights seem to go crazy over seemingly trivial regulations. What’s the big deal if you have to wait a week to buy a gun? By itself, the answer is plainly, “Yea, it’s not a big deal.” But what if this waiting period is part of a larger plan to gradually ban guns step-by-step? Then it’s hardly crazy to just draw a line in the sand and stonewall “not one step further.” Is there a larger plan to gradually ban guns? Yes. Anti-gun activists’ long-run goal is plainly a ban or near-ban. This is no conspiracy theory. Just listen to what they say and watch what they do. Opponents’ “model countries” - such as Japan - almost totally ban guns. And when anti-gun forces get the upper hand in a city or state, they come about as close to a ban as the Supreme Court tolerates. They virtually never criticize any government on Earth for excessive gun regulation. Should individuals be allowed to own a machine gun? Anti-tank missiles? Nuclear weapons? I’m not an absolutist here. Hardly anyone is. If everyone who wants a weapon wants it for evil purposes, there’s nothing wrong with banning it. If some people who want a weapon are harmless, and others aren’t, though, you should weigh lives saved by the ban against the mistreatment of the innocent. As you ponder these issues, make an effort to ignore angry activists who pretend that innocent enthusiasts don’t exist or don’t count. They exist and they count. In a well-functioning society, media and politicians would try to calm popular reactions to tragedies. But in the real-world, media and politicians generally do the opposite. When the public is angry, they try to make them angrier. Why? Sometimes this is merely because the media and politicians, like other humans, respond emotionally. But most are probably consciously fueling popular emotions to make more money and gain more power. Either way, these demagogues deserve neither your trust nor your respect. Contrary to the fear-mongering of the media and politicians, children are almost never murdered in the United States. By anyone. In any place. In any manner. For any reason. If you look at the 2018 numbers, for instance, you’ll see that under 700 children ages 0-14 were murdered in the entire country, out of a total child population of about 60 million. Murder is not a danger kids should fret over. Adults who say otherwise are bad at math, and you should ignore them. If listening to me has made you angrier about this issue, I have failed. My goal, to repeat, is to help you think carefully and calmly in the face of tragedy. I’d do better if I could, but I don’t know how. In case you’re wondering, I have never fired a gun. I am not emotional about this issue. If you want to understand the science and ethics of gun regulation, you shouldn’t be emotional either.;1487

Voters as Mad Scientists: Essays on Political Irrationality;https://betonit.substack.com/p/voters-as-mad-scientists-essays-on;Voters as Mad Scientists: Essays on Political Irrationality, the next installment in my eight-volume series of “the best essays I’ve ever written,” is now available for purchase. Here’s what legendary political psychologist Phil Tetlock has to say about the new book: In my 44 years as a professor, I’ve noticed a jarring mismatch between how we academics like to think of ourselves (courageous truth seekers) and how we often behave (status-grubbing cowards). Bryan Caplan is an extreme outlier. This collection of essays shows that he is pretty close to fearless. Plus he has an impressive track record. Yet more remarkable, he believes in keeping track records. Despite tons of inflation, I’m keeping the price at $12 for the paperback and $9.99 for the e-book. With the exception of Don’t Be a Feminist, these are all books of previously published material. What then do you get for your money? Curation, convenience, and coolness. And unless you’ve already read every word I’ve ever written, much of the book will be new to you. Voters as Mad Scientists comes in four parts. Part I, Vicious Voters, explores the gross intellectual negligence of the common man. Part II, The Fog of Politics, tries to clarify our confusing political world, focusing on my Ideological Turing Test and Simplistic Theory of Left and Right. Part III, Mad Misconceptions, goes through a zoo of bizarre political dogmas. The final part, Selling Freedom, ponders ways to make the value and efficacy of freedom more salient in a world where authoritarian politics is the ruling religion. If you like Bet On It, I say there’s at least a 90% chance you’ll find this book worth your time and money. P.S. As always, I am budgeting a lot of time for promotion. Any book worth writing is worth selling! If you want to do interviews on Voters as Mad Scientists for radio, TV, podcasts, or anything else, just email me and we’ll set something up.;340
Feminist Caricature;https://betonit.substack.com/p/feminist-caricature;car·i·ca·ture (noun): exaggeration by means of often ludicrous distortion of parts or characteristics A few weeks ago, I debated feminism against Kat Murti and Cathy Reisenwitz for Bob Zadek’s Free for All web show. With five participants (the panelists plus Bob and his co-host, Big John), getting a word in edgewise was a challenge. Yet by the end, I reached an epiphany: While feminists often claim to be unfairly caricatured, their movement is guilty of severe caricature of non-feminists. How so? On the show, Kat and Cathy characterize feminism as both (a) the belief that men and women should be treated equally, and (b) opposition to sexism. These are standard feminist talking points. Now recall: In the most recent relevant survey, 53% of American adults say they aren’t feminists. So: When you say that “feminism is just the belief that men and women should be treated equally,” you are by implication claiming that 53% of American adults are non-believers in gender equality. And: When you say that “feminism is just opposition to sexism,” you are by implication claiming that 53% of American adults are non-opponents of sexism. Which are plainly silly caricatures! If you have any doubt, such claims: Go against the best survey evidence, which shows that over 90% of non-feminists do believe that “men and women should be social, political, and economic equals.” Go against almost every conversation you’ve had in real life. How many people have ever questioned gender equality to your face? Defended sexism to your face? Go against the opinions you’ve read in almost any mainstream newspaper. When was the last noted op-ed published in defense of gender inequality or sexism? Go against the views expressed on network and cable news. Go against every textbook you were assigned in public school. Yes, outright opponents of gender equality and defenders of sexism do exist, but you have to go to the internet to find them. Because that’s where every kind of crazy lives. Admittedly, if you’re hypersensitive, you can interpret almost any gender-related statement as a blatant attack on gender equality and defense of sexism. But you shouldn’t be hypersensitive. On the other hand, my proposed definition of feminism - “the view that our society generally treats men more fairly than women” - is no caricature. It is etymological truth. We’re now up to the Fourth Wave of the feminist movement, but complaining about the fairness gap continues. “Our society generally treats men more fairly than women” isn’t just a weird view that a few internet trolls believe. It is the view that feminists have been pushing from the start. When you give them the floor, they habitually enumerate long lists of injustices against women. Their lists of injustices against men are much shorter. Or non-existent. By way of contrast, all of the following are caricatures of feminism: “Feminism is the view that our society is heaven for men and hell for women.” “Feminism is the view that our society always treats men more fairly than women.” “Feminism is the view that only women endure unfair treatment in our society.” “Feminism is the view that all men are evil.” “Feminism is the view that the male gender should be exterminated.” These are, indeed, ludicrous positions. While a few feminists believe them (paging Valerie Solanas and her SCUM Manifesto), most do not. My point is that the patriarchal and sexist views that feminists ascribe by implication to non-feminists are in the same hyperbolic ballpark. As caricaturists, feminists are more sinning than sinned against, by far. So much so that I’m tempted to modify my definition to, “Feminism is the view that our society generally treats men more fairly than women - and that you have to be foolish or evil to disagree.”;644
